35928 "Joan of Arc:\nIt is a war that has lasted for one hundred years, and the French have lost nearly every battle. Soon the English and their allies in Burgundy will conquer all of France. The heir to the French monarchy is too cowardly to ascend to the throne. The French army is wounded and tired and has given up all hope. But in the darkest hour, a young peasant girl declares that she intends to save France."
35958 "Saladin:\nOutraged that the Holy Land is ruled by Saracens, knights from Europe have descended upon the Middle East in a series of Crusades. Now four European kingdoms have sprung up in the desert. The Saracen king, Saladin, rallies his troops in an attempt to drive back the invaders. In response to European Crusades, the Saracens have organized a Jihad. In response to European vileness, the once-cultured Saracens have become treacherous. But will it be enough to save their homeland?"
35988 "Genghis Khan:\nThe nomadic tribes of the Asian steppes spent centuries entangled in their own petty feuds until united under Genghis Khan. Within years, a highly disciplined army pours out of Mongolia to embark on a campaign of world conquest. But how can a tribe of horse archers possibly overcome the military might of Persia and Eastern Europe, let alone the technologically advanced empires in China?"
36018 "Barbarossa:\nCan the will of one man forge an empire? Frederick Barbarossa attempts to force the squabbling German fiefdoms into his Holy Roman Empire, which he then must defend from the machinations of the Italian city states and the pope in Rome. And should he accomplish all of those feats, there is always the Third Crusade to wage."

Take command of the highlanders, and learn the basic concepts of Age of Empires II: HD Edition, such as how to build an economy, how to train your soldiers and, most importantly, how to fight and defeat your enemy. If you are new to real-time strategy games, you will learn all you need to know. If you have played the original Age of Empires, then you can skip ahead to new features, such as garrisoning and formations."

36167 "Experienced Age of Empires players may start with Scenario 6 - Forge an Alliance"
36228 "Attila the Hun:\nBarbarian hordes feast on the dying Roman empire. The most dangerous of these invaders are the Huns and their ferocious king, Attila. After pouring out of the Caspian steppes, looting and burning all the while, the Huns become so powerful that the Roman Empire is forced to pay a tribute to Attila. But the king of the Huns is still not satisfied, and he mobilizes his horsemen to invade Gaul and eventually Rome itself! Can nothing stop the brutal Attila?"
36258 "El Cid:\nSpain is divided between Christian kingdoms to the north and Moorish kingdoms to the south. In the barren borderlands of Castille, Rodrigo Díaz, called El Cid, gains notoriety as a brilliant general and heroic crusader. The Cid is so popular among soldiers and peasants alike that the distrustful King of Castille sends him into exile. The Cid must join forces with his former enemies, the Moors, and fight against his beloved Castille. But an even greater threat waits across the sea in Africa, where fanatical Berber horsemen are eager to seize what the Moors could not."
36288 "Montezuma:\nCenturies of conquest have allowed the Aztecs to become the mightiest empire in Central America. But when strangers appear on the shores of the Caribbean Sea, Montezuma, emperor of the Aztecs, is unsure whether they are conquerors…or gods. Can a vast empire of warriors using obsidian spears and cotton armor hold off mounted invaders armed with metal armor and gunpowder? Will the Aztec island-city of Tenochtitlan continue to conquer the Americas, or will it crumble beneath these foreign conquerors?"
36318 "The Conquerors:\nCertain names ring down through history as men and women who shaped the world. Some were forces of chaos, destructive and rapacious. Some were men of honor who fought for the right. Some defended their homelands from invaders, while others used their military might to violently acquire the lands of others. Battles such as Agincourt, Manzikert, and Hastings are remembered as turning points in world history, and names such as Henry V, Yi Sun-shin, and Erik the Red are etched forever as great conquerors. Now relive their tragedies and triumphs. "
36428 "Alaric:\nThe trauma of the Hun invasion in the 4th century has shaped Alaric, the fearsome warrior king of the Goths. Fleeing his ravaged homeland as a child, Alaric spent the rest of his life searching for a new place to call home. Can the beloved king secure a new homeland for his people in the territory of the collapsing Roman Empire?"
36458 "Dracula:\nHistory forged an incredible legend around the man who ruled Wallachia in the mid-15th century. Holding his ground against the vast armies of the expanding Ottoman Empire, his cruel tactics made him the most feared man in all of Eastern Europe. Shall his thirst for blood and the loyalty of his soldiers be enough to hold the Turks back for good?"
36488 "Bari:\n400 years after the collapse of the Roman empire, Italy is still up for grabs. In the deep south, Byzantines, Goths, Normans and Muslims all vie for control of the port city of Bari. Relive the tale of the city from the point of view of a Byzantine family, rising from the common soldiery to the nobility. But beware, for not only Bari is at stake, but also control of Southern Italy."
36518 "Sforza:\nAfter witnessing the death of his father, the young captain did not hesitate to take over command of his father's Condottieri. Always hungry for glory and wealth, Sforza wanders around 15th century Italy, offering his services to the highest bidder. Will he pick the right battles or make the wrong enemy? Take the fate of the young mercenary captain in your hands."
36548 "El Dorado:\nJoin Francisco Orellana and Gonzalo Pizarro on their quest to find El Dorado, the legendary Lost City of Gold, thought to be hidden somewhere in the vast Amazon rain forest. Will their quest along the Amazon river lead to lifelong prosperity or will they drown in their sorrow?"
36578 "Prithviraj:\nAs the 12th century comes to a close, India is divided between the ruling Rajput clans. One of them, the Chauhans, have just been blessed with a new king. His name is Prithviraj and his determination to unite the rival states is unprecedented. But what happens when he falls in love with the daughter of his enemy? And does he have the strength to stop a full-scale Muslim invasion from the west?"
36608 "Battles of the Forgotten:\nTime has faded the names of many of the greatest leaders ever known. During their age they were famed for their fierceness on the battlefield, their just rule and their quest for power. Witness the path to glory of Richard the Lionheart, Minamoto no Yoritomo, Sultan Osman Ghazi, Khosrau and many more."

44316 "Congratulations! Advancing to the next age is the best way to improve your civilization."
44317 "Good. You are on your way to the Feudal Age. "
44318 "To win, you will need to advance to the Feudal Age and repel the English raids."
44319 "The English use very advanced weapons and armor."
44320 "Upgrading to Man-at-Arms will change all your Militia units to the more powerful Men-at-Arms."

44403 "This scenario begins in a similar way to Random Map games. After you play this scenario, you should know all you need to play a Random Map game.\n\nKeep exploring!"
44404 "The time has come to take the offensive. The English have a fort near the town of Stirling. If we can defeat the English here, they may think twice about their invasion of Scotland."
44405 "Before we attack the English to the west, we need to build up our forces. Have your villagers start gathering food and wood."
44406 "Keep making villagers at your Town Center until you have 10. The more villagers you have, the faster your resources will come in."
44407 "You can gain more food by building Fishing Ships. To create Fishing Ships, have your villagers build a Dock in the water to the south."
44408 "Now click the Dock, and build a Fishing Ship."
44409 "To fish, click a Fishing Ship and RIGHT-click on a leaping fish. The Fishing Ship will collect fish and automatically return them to the Dock. Fishing Ships are also useful for exploring."
44410 "Scout Cavalry are poor fighters but they can see a great distance. You can use your Scout Cavalry to explore the rest of the map and find the English. "
44411 "The hill with the dead tree protects the only access to your town. It would be a good idea to build a Watch Tower on this hill once you advance to the Feudal Age."
44412 "An English Outpost! You know what to do … knock it down!"
44413 "You are close to the English base. Better not knock down this wall until you have an army of about 12 soldiers."
44414 "Now you have a large enough force to attack the English base. Charge! Keep your villagers working just in case you suffer casualties and need to make more troops."
44415 "Defeat the English army and destroy their Tower."
44416 "Great job! You have destroyed the English camp. The Battle of Stirling is sure to end in victory for the Scots!"
44417 "Now that you have reached the Feudal Age, concentrate on making some soldiers to fight the enemy. You will need at least 12."
44418 "The English are coming to attack! To protect your villagers, you can use the town bell to garrison them in your Town Center. Click your Town Center, then click Town Bell."
44419 "Good! You defeated the English assault. If you have villagers in your Town Center, ring the town bell again to send them back to work."
44420 "Good! Your Watch Tower will fire on enemy units and help protect your town."
44421 "You have found some sheep! Sheep are a good source of food, so send them back to your Town Center and assign a villager to gather food from them."
44422 "Now that you know how to build up, advance through the ages, and find and fight your enemies, you have all the basic skills you need to play a Random Map game, the most common type of game in Age of Empires II."
44423 "Remember, you can upgrade your Militia to Men-at-Arms at the Barracks. You should always upgrade soldiers when you can afford it."
44424 "Build a Barracks and 5 Militia to defend your villagers and explore the map."
44425 "To win, destroy the English tower to the west."
44426 "Use your villagers to build a Mill near your forage bushes."
44427 "Once you have gathered 500 food, advance to the Feudal Age at your Town Center. If you are low on food, build some additional Farms."
44428 "Remember to upgrade weapons and armor at the Blacksmith. You do have a Blacksmith, don't you?"
44429 "Villagers can also build Farms. Build 4 Farms near your Mill when your forage bushes are depleted. Each Farm needs only one villager working on it."
44430 "Good job! You have eliminated the English soldiers. Now destroy that tower and our victory will be complete."
44431 "You can specify a location for new units to gather by setting a gather point. For villagers, click the Town Center and click the Set Gather Point button."

44505 "The Scottish army has been rallied by recent victories against the English. The situation is starting to look up."
44506 "It will help the morale of our army to collect holy relics and place them in our Monastery. One of the relics is close to your town. An ally has another relic, and the English have captured a third."
44507 "You can retrieve a relic by clicking a Monk and RIGHT-clicking the relic. Monks have other abilities as well. They can heal your injured soldiers or those of your allies. They can also attempt to convert enemy soldiers to join your army."
44508 "Good, you have a relic! Protect the relic in the Monastery by RIGHT-clicking the Monastery."
44509 "It is nice to have allies on the map. Your ally (the yellow player) can help you fight the enemy. You can also trade with your allies. To trade, you will need to build a Market."
44510 "You have a Market! The Market can create Trade Carts to generate extra gold. You can also exchange one resource for another at the Market for a small fee. Click the Market, then click Sell Food for Gold."
44511 "You made a Trade Cart! If you click the Trade Cart on your ally's Market, you can make extra gold. Your Trade Cart will automatically make trips between your and your ally's Markets."
44512 "Scottish ally: Welcome! If you have come for the relic, you can find it on the hill to the northeast of our town."
44513 "Scottish ally: The English are attacking our town! Can you tribute any spare food or gold to us?"
44514 "To tribute your ally, click the Diplomacy button in the upper-right corner of the screen. Give your ally some food and gold, but don't give him everything you own!"
44515 "Scottish ally: Thanks for the resources. If you have any spare soldiers, come to our town and let's drive the English out!"
44516 "You have enough soldiers now to think about attacking the English and recovering their relic."
44517 "Scottish ally: If you are getting ready to attack the English, I can help you out. Here, take this food and wood."
44518 "Capture 3 relics and garrison them in your Monastery."
44519 "Congratulations! You have captured all 3 relics!"
44520 "You have reached your ally's town. Go inside to see how his city is doing. Your ally's gate will open automatically for you."
44521 "Farms are a good source of food once you have exhausted forage bushes and animals. Farms are built like buildings and must be periodically rebuilt. To gather food from a Farm, click a villager, then RIGHT-click a Farm."
44522 "Villagers and soldiers normally appear outside of the building that created them. You can have your units move to a spot once they are created by using gather points. "
44523 "To set a gather point for infantry, click your Barracks, click Set Gather Point, then click where on the map you want your infantry to gather."

For example the Scots, who are represented by the Celtic civilization, have powerful infantry. The Britons have long-range archers."
44604 "Destroy the English castle."
44605 "The English castle at Falkirk is no more! The English pretensions in Scotland are surely at an end. The forces of Wallace are triumphant."
44606 "Build a Castle."
44607 "Great! You have completed the Castle. Sir William should be here soon, and then it will be time to attack the English!"
44608 "Wallace has come!"
44609 "The English could attack at any time. You have some walls already, but you should complete them as soon as you have enough stone."
44610 "One of your most powerful units is created at the Castle. Create 10 more Woad Raiders."
44611 "Trebuchets are massive siege weapons with a great range, available only in the Imperial Age. Remember that Trebuchets must be packed to move and unpacked to fire."
44612 "To build a Castle, you must first advance to the next age: the Castle Age."
44613 "You also can build towers to defend your city. Units can garrison within a tower for defense and protection and archers can even fire out of a tower."
44614 "Congratulations. You are going to find lots of things to do in the Castle Age. For starters, try building a Siege Workshop to make Battering Rams and other siege weapons."
44615 "Good job. With your new Siege Workshop you can make Battering Rams. Rams are slow, but they are resistant to arrow fire and excellent at knocking down walls. You may need some rams to attack the English castle."
44616 "You may need to assign extra villagers to gather stone so you'll have enough to build the Castle and all of the fortifications you need."
44617 "The advanced buttons allow access to a new type of formation. For example, with a box formation, you can protect a weak unit."
44618 "The advanced buttons let you set combat states for your soldiers. A defensive soldier will be less likely to attack an enemy that comes near him. Click a military unit, then note the combat stance buttons in the lower-left corner of the screen."
44619 "Using the advanced buttons, you can also command a soldier to patrol an area between two points and guard or follow another unit."
44620 "With William Wallace and his Woad Raiders on your side, the English may be in trouble. Once you have a large army with plenty of siege weapons, go destroy the English Castle!"
44621 "If you have surplus resources of one type, you can sell them for gold at your Market. You can then use the gold to buy what you need."

44708 "Scout: I spotted a nest of Burgundians to the north. Best to go another way."
44709 "De Metz: The bridge is out. The British must have destroyed it. We must find another way to Chinon. "
44710 "De Metz: A Burgundian encampment! We'll never get through that wall without siege equipment."

60005 "1. Bleda may be defeated in several ways; you can change your stance with him to Enemy and attack him, see that he dies in an accident, or refuse his challenge altogether and flee the Hun camp. \n\n 2. Look for allies in unlikely places. The Scythians (green) are not on good terms with the Romans (blue) so it may be possible to convince the two to fight against each other. \n\n 3. The Huns may only reach the Castle Age."
60006 "Attila must survive."

60018 "<PURPLE>Bleda the Hun: Get out of my sight, Attila, and take your traitors with you. I have no brother!"
60019 "<PURPLE>Bleda the Hun: Attila, that boar would have killed me had you not intervened."
60020 "<PURPLE>Bleda the Hun: Pity that none will ever learn of your loyalty. Archers, attack!"
60021 "<PURPLE>Bleda the Hun: Tracks, brother. Ride ahead and see if you can flush the boar out."
60022 "<PURPLE>Hun Commander: Bleda will lead us to ruin. Perhaps he should not return from his boar hunt. Accidents can happen…."
60023 "<PURPLE>Hun Tarkan: Bleda is no more. When Attila returns to camp he alone will rule the Huns!"
60024 "<PURPLE>Hun Tarkan: Bleda wastes our time. Let us follow Attila."
60025 "<YELLOW>Hun Tarkan: We ride with you, Attila."
60026 "<YELLOW>Hun Tarkan: Let us go. Bleda will soon seek you out. Some of our families are across the western river. We should see to them."
60027 "<YELLOW>Hun Tarkan: This road leads to a bridge in both directions. Northwest is the way we want. South leads to the Romans."
60028 "<YELLOW>Hun Tarkan: This is the bridge of which I spoke."
60029 "<YELLOW>Hun Tarkan: We razed this Roman camp to the ground."
60030 "<YELLOW>Hun Villager: Attila! Welcome! We are not many who follow you, but we will follow where you lead -- lead us to glory!"
60031 "<PURPLE>Hun Tarkan: It was an ambush! Bleda tried to kill Atilla. Bleda is not fit to rule!"
60032 "<YELLOW>Hun Tarkan: Let us slay the rest of the traitors."
60033 "<YELLOW>Hun Tarkan: Attila is king of the Huns! He will lead us to victory against our blood enemies."
60034 "<PURPLE>Hun Tarkan: And what were you doing in the forest, noble archer, if not waiting to ambush Attila at Bleda's command? We are best rid of Bleda -- hail Attila!"
60035 "<YELLOW>Hun Tarkan: Attila has fallen! Woe to the Huns! We will weep blood and bitter tears."
60036 "<YELLOW>Hun Tarkan: Some time ago the Romans captured a number of Hun villagers. Bleda arranged for their return, but I do not trust Bleda and I do not trust the Romans. We should free them -- no bargaining!"
60037 "<GREEN>Scythian Scout: My thanks for rescuing me. We nomads should work together. Perhaps if your leader, Attila, will visit our village in the west our people can make an alliance. For now, a truce?"
60038 "<GREEN>Scythian Scout: Wait! I am the son of the Leopoxais, a leader amongst my people. If you free me you will be rewarded."
60039 "<GREEN>Scythian Scout: Wild horses have stampeded through our town and scattered the herd. They must be found and returned to the palisade."
60040 "<GREEN>Scythian Leopoxais: Welcome, Attila. We greet you with lowered bows. My thanks for the safe return of my son. You are an honored guest. Continue west until you begin to see our palisades."
60041 "<GREEN>Scythian Leopoxais: We owe the Huns more than our gratitude, but we desperately need Horses. If you could supply us with 10 Horses we will repay our debt of honor."
60042 "<GREEN>Scythian Leopoxais: Attila's honor is meaningless! We will bring death to the treacherous Huns."

60049 "<YELLOW>Hun Villager: We are saved!"
60050 "Your scouts report: Attila the Hun (yellow) initially commands no troops as all of the Huns are loyal to the Hunnic king, Bleda. Attila must somehow depose Bleda in order to inherit troops and villagers. \n\n There are three other enemies scattered across the landscape. The Western Roman Empire (blue) has a fort to the south where it holds some Huns captive. The Romans rely on their infantry in combat. \n\n The Scythians (green) have a scattered encampment to the west. Because the Scythians are a nomadic people, there are unmined reserves of stone in their area. \n\n The most dangerous enemy is the Persian city across the bay to the east. The Persians hoard lots of gold, but their army consists of Mangonels and War Elephants as well as a considerable navy."

Your Tarkans will suggest what to do in each village to capture a resource. \n\n 2. This is a raid -- get what you can and get out! Destroying some buildings will grant you resources, but it is not necessary to raze every enemy building. \n\n 3. Notice locations of resources. You might need them at a later date. \n\n 4. The Huns are still confined to the Castle Age."
60109 "Raid the Roman villages. Once you have enough resources to build a forward base, then you can field an army against the Romans."
60110 "Train an army and defeat the Romans by leveling their Town Center."
60111 "OPTIONAL: Give 6 villagers to the Scythian Wild Women in return for their assistance."
60112 "<BLUE>Eastern Roman Empire: Huns have ransacked our fort! I fear for the future of the Empire!"
60113 "<ORANGE>Scythian Wild Woman: You are most foolish to trespass here. If you bring us 6 of your villagers, we will make it worth your while."
60114 "<ORANGE>Scythian Wild Women: We thank you for this gift. Your reward waits in the clearing to the north."
60115 "<YELLOW>Hun Soldier: Now that we have a base, we must train many riders to withstand the Roman attack and then go on the offensive!"
60116 "<YELLOW>Hun Soldier: The Eastern Roman Empire is fielding their army. We must hasten with our raid so that we have enough resources to train our own army."
60117 "<YELLOW>Hun Soldier: Let us raze the Sofia Town Center with our Tarkans and see what loot we may find!"
60118 "<YELLOW>Hun Soldier: The Sofians had much food stockpiled in their Town Center."
60119 "<YELLOW>Hun Soldier: The locals speak of wild Scythians that dwell somewhere nearby. We should be cautious."
60120 "<YELLOW>Hun Soldier: I do not like the looks of this…."
60121 "<YELLOW>Hun Soldier: I remember this place. They took several of our raiders prisoner before. We must rescue our Hun brothers held at the Castle before they are executed."

60124 "<YELLOW>Hun Soldier: Roman gold! There is no other metal than shines as sweetly."
60125 "<YELLOW>Hun Soldier: The town of Naissus produces the best lumber in the region. Let us take all we can by destroying these Lumber Camps."
60126 "<YELLOW>Hun Soldier: The gold mines of Adrianople deserve to be plundered! Let us destroy all of their Mining Camps."
60127 "<YELLOW>Hun Soldier: Huns do not need houses! Let us burn these to the ground and take these villagers with us."
60128 "<YELLOW>Hun Soldier: Now that we have defeated Dyrrhachium, we can easily free the prisoners."
60129 "<YELLOW>Hun Soldier: If we attack the Roman fort with too few soldiers, we will surely die."

You cannot merely trade resources for the gold you needed. Your objective is to exact a tribute from the Romans. \n\n 4. The Huns may not go to the Imperial Age."

60206 "<YELLOW>Hun Soldier: The Romans have given us the gold we need. Now we can truly establish a Hunnic empire!"
60207 "<YELLOW>Hun Soldier: Attila, we have found a gold mine. 'Tis not much, but it will help us attain our goal."
60208 "<YELLOW>Hun Soldier: Perhaps we underestimated the defenses of Constantinople. We are not equipped for a direct siege, though perhaps we can destroy their docks…."
60209 "<BLUE>Constantinople: You have destroyed our shipyards! We will pay you 500 gold to cease these attacks."
60210 "<BLUE>Constantinople: Curse you, Huns! Will 500 more gold stay your hand?"
60211 "<BLUE>Constantinople: The Huns have torched Marcianopolis! Please, take this 3000 gold and just go away."
60212 "<BLUE>Constantinople: The Huns have razed yet another dock? When will it end?"
60213 "<BLUE>Constantinople: The Huns have claimed two more Docks, in the shadow of our Castle, no less. Perhaps we should buy them off…."
60214 "<BLUE>Constantinople: The Huns have built a Castle on Roman land! Let us send them 500 gold as a sign of goodwill."
60215 "<BLUE>Constantinople: You Huns are disrupting our trade routes. Take this gold and be gone!"
60216 "<BLUE>Constantinople: You Huns have sunk our merchant fleet! Just take this 500 gold and leave our seas!"
60217 "<BLUE>Constantinople: Philippopilis has lost its Town Center. Why won't these Huns just leave?"
60218 "<BLUE>Constantinople: Now the Huns are attacking the docks at Philippopolis. Can nothing be done about them?"
60219 "<BLUE>Constantinople: Attila, King of the Huns, if we give you 500 more gold will you cease these raids?"
60220 "<BLUE>Constantinople: No! You must not destroy our Wonder -- the cornerstone of our city. Take this, please, and leave!"
60221 "<BLUE>Constantinople: Now the Huns destroy our places of worship. Truly, they are barbarians who love nothing but gold."
60222 "Your scouts report: The Huns (yellow) have a small town that they will need to defend against early attacks from Marcianopolis (green). \n\n Marcianopolis does not have a strong army, but their town is walled, which can prevent an early Hunnic attack. Once you breach the gates, however, the town should crumble. \n\n Phillippopolis (red) is defended only by a few towers initially, but they will train an army of infantry and Light Cavalry. \n\n Constantinople (blue) is by far the greatest threat. The city's famous walls are very hard to siege but it is not necessary to do so. Extort money from the Romans, and you will be victorious."

60311 "OPTIONAL: Burgundy will join you if you build a Castle within the flagged area of their town within 10 minutes."
60312 "<PURPLE>Burgundy: Please, spare us, oh great Huns! We would join you if you could only tribute to us 500 gold and then build a Castle in our town to help defend us!"
60313 "<PURPLE>Burgundy: I hope I am not making a mistake…but for now, we ride with the Huns!"
60314 "<PURPLE>Burgundy: We appreciate your show of good faith. Now if you build a Castle within our town, we will know that you can be trusted. You have 10 minutes."
60315 "<PURPLE>Burgundy: It is just like a Hun to break his promise. We asked for a simple Castle, but I suppose no one asks favors of Attila the Hun."
60316 "<YELLOW>Hun Soldier: Our forces are weak and scattered from recent attacks. We must regroup before we ravage the Frankish countryside."
60317 "<BLUE>Western Roman Empire: You have burned your last town!"
60318 "Your scouts report: After invading Gaul, the Huns begin scattered. They must regroup while avoiding stumbling too close to Burgundy (purple) in the south, Metz (red) to the north or the great city of Orléans (cyan) to the northwest. \n\n Burgundy trains archers, rams, and infantry, but is not well-defended and might fall to an early attack. The Burgundians are easily intimidated and might even be persuaded to join the Hunnic cause. \n\n Metz makes up for Burgundy's weakness with an army of Knights and Throwing Axemen. Their Castle and proximity to Orléans offers them some defense. \n\n Orléans is a walled city protected by Towers and Castles. Its army of Spearmen, Knights, and Monks may prove a challenge for the Huns. \n\n Scouts also report that the Western Roman Empire is sending Aetius' army to reinforce Gaul. The Romans have no town in the area, but their legions and Cataphracts could strike at any time."

Their fate is none of the Huns' concern. \n\n Among your enemies, the Romans are the most dangerous.

The Hun unique technology, Atheism, is very useful if your opponent attempts a Relic or Wonder victory. \n\n 3. Do not send all of your troops on the offensive if you lack sufficient resources to defend your town. \n\n 4.

Below lie the well-defended city states of Northern Italy. \n\n Milan (green) has an agressive army that may come looking for you if you take too long to go on the offensive. Milan trains Knights and Archers and has a small navy. \n\n Padua (purple) also lies to the north and may attack early. Padua is known for its Archers and siege weapons. \n\n In the northern marshes lies Aquileia (red), which has few soldiers initially, but can eventually field Knights, Spearmen, and Scorpions. \n\n As the Huns advance through Italy, they will eventually come into contact with Verona (orange), whose Knights, Archers, and Throwing Axemen offer the final defense of the Roman Empire. \n\n Rome itself (blue) lost most of its forces fighting the Huns in Gaul.

60719 "<YELLOW>King Sancho: Rodrigo, you know of my brother Alfonso. You also know of his ambition to rule all of Spain. I need you to travel to his Castle at Golpejera, capture Alfonso and bring him to me so that I may…persuade him that ruling Leon is enough."
60720 "<YELLOW>Castillian Army: The Cid!"
60721 "<YELLOW>King Sancho: El Cid, so great a Champion as yourself must have a charger to carry him into battle. Go to my stable and retrieve the steed that is now yours."

60723 "<YELLOW>King Sancho: Your army has assembled -- look!"

He has a well-fortified city. Your initial forces can probably damage his city, but it is likely you will need to train some reinforcements, particularly siege weapons, to destroy his Castle. The border between Golpejera to the north and the Castillian border Castles to the south should have ample space and resources. \n\n Alfonso trains Knights and Pikemen, so guard your cavalry with Pikemen of your own."

60911 "Defeat Count Berenguer."
60912 "El Cid must survive."
60913 "<GREEN>Motamid: We meet again, El Cid. You could not have arrived at a better time. The army of Count Berenguer is approaching our gates! Defeat him, and you may have the land outside my city gates as your own."
60914 "<BLUE>Alfonso's Soldier: My Cid, I know that the king is irate, but I am certain you do not mean to leave without your trusty Bavieca! She waits for you in the stable to the northwest."
60915 "<BLUE>Alfonso's Soldier: My Cid, here is your horse. Do not judge King Alfonso too harshly. We will open the gates for you now. Godspeed."
60916 "<BLUE>King Alfonso: That's enough of a head start. If The Cid shows his face near our city again, you may open fire."
60917 "<GREEN>Moor Camel: Greetings, my Cid. My lord Motamid has heard of your situation and welcomes you to join him at his city of Zaragoza. It is just a short ride to the southeast of here."
60918 "<RED>Knight: King Alfonso is a fool to send you into exile. We will follow where you lead, my Cid."
60919 "<GREEN>Moor Camel: My Cid, King Alfonso has blockaded the gap leading to Zaragoza. If we are to get through, we must siege his Castle. Perhaps we can find the troops we need to the south."
60920 "<BLUE>King Alfonso: El Cid, we stand nothing to gain by fighting against each other. Let us call a truce and each just go our separate ways."
60921 "<GREEN>Moor Villager: My Cid! What little we have is yours, if you can just destroy Alfonso's castle to the north."
60922 "<GREEN>Motamid: Thank you for saving my city. Here is a small reward for your trouble. Now you may use these villagers to build your own encampment northwest of Zaragoza. But be vigilant, Berenguer may come again!"
60923 "<RED>Spanish Soldier: The Cid has fallen in battle!"
60924 "<GREEN>Moor Camel: My Cid, we should not travel in this direction, for it leads to the holds of our enemy, Lord Berenguer. Zaragoza lies to the south of here."
60925 "<BLUE>King Alfonso: I cannot stand the sight of you, El Cid. I command that you leave my kingdom at once!"
60926 "Your scouts report: El Cid (red) starts alone in exile. Do not fear, for you will soon find recruits to your cause. You will have little in the way of an economy until you meet up with an old friend. \n\n King Alfonso (blue) is your enemy, but he is more of an annoyance than a threat. The real enemy is Count Berenguer of Barcelona (purple). He will send swordsmen, Knights, Scorpions, and Battering Rams your way. \n\n Motamid the Moor (green) is a potential ally as are any other Moors you may encounter."

61024 "<YELLOW>Black Guard Monk: You are most tolerant, my Cid. Take our Mosque under your protection by sending a holy man to convert it and, though I should not, I will help you to defeat Yusuf and his Black Guard."
61025 "<YELLOW>Black Guard Monk: Our thanks, my Cid. I feel free to help you because I have forseen your victory. I seek only to bring the bloodshed to a swift close."
61026 "<YELLOW>Black Guard Monk: The Transports are the key. Destroy the Black Guard Navy's Transports and you will effectively cripple the arrival of reinforcements."
61027 "<YELLOW>Black Guard Monk: Also…El Cid, if you should wish to leave a holy man here at the Mosque, we will teach him all that we know."
61028 "<RED>Spanish Soldier: That was the last of the Black Guard Navy's transports. That should delay their reinforcements indefinitely!"
61029 "<RED>Spanish Soldier: We are halfway through the Black Guard Navy's Docks and halfway to stopping the advance of Yusuf's invasion!"
61030 "<RED>Monk Studying at Mosque: I have learned of Sanctity, now I shall learn of Fervor."

61035 "<RED>Monk Studying at Mosque: We now know of Illumination. The monks will soon teach me their Block Printing."
61036 "<RED>Monk Studying at Mosque: The technique of Block Printing is ours. Now I will learn the might of Theocracy."
61037 "<RED>Monk Studying at Mosque: We have discussed, debated, and learned of Theocracy. Now I will delve into the mysteries of Faith."
61038 "<RED>Monk Studying at Mosque: The wonderment of Faith is with us, my Cid. The Black Guard Monks thank you and have taught me all they know."
61039 "Your scouts report: El Cid's forces (red) are allied with those of King Alfonso (blue). \n\n There are three enemies, the Black Guard Army (cyan), the Black Guard Navy (Yellow) and Yusuf's Elite Guard (Green). The two land armies field mostly Camel and siege units. The navy trains Galleys and Spearmen. \n\n All three of your enemies have walled cities with many towers, so try using Trebuchets and garrisoned Battering Rams against them. Eventually, you may need to build a navy as well. You can construct your Docks within the city of a vanquished enemy or in the no man's land between the cities."

61122 "Your scouts report: El Cid (red) is alone again and this time Motamid cannot come to his assistance. \n\n There are several towns in southern Spain that might prove allies, Denia (green), Lérida (orange), and Valencia (yellow). None of these towns can field a large military. \n\n El Cid's enemy is once again Count Berenguer (purple). Berenguer has a well-fortified city in the north that will prove very difficult to siege.

The Black Guard Army is composed mostly of Camels and Cavalry Archers. \n\n  The Black Guard Navy is west of Valencia but can be reached by land. The Navy is better defended than the Army but can still be attacked early. In addition to cavalry, the Black Guard Navy has some Monks. \n\n  Yusuf is the most dangerous enemy.

61707 "<GREEN>Aztec Warrior: We have trained a horse rider."
61708 "<GREEN>Aztec Warrior: My emperor, we have been studying Spanish horses and cannon and have found that there is no reason Aztecs could not use these weapons, provided we had the proper materials."
61709 "<GREEN>Aztec Warrior: If we capture Spanish horses, it is possible that we can train cavalry of our own. If we capture their stores of gunpowder, we could even create some cannons to use against the Spanish."

It still might be possible to locate an undefended landing spot. \n\n The Spanish army is just to the north of Tenochtitlan. The Spanish have constructed gates and Castles to defend their forces. Expect to encounter Knights, Conquistadors, Missionaries, and Bombard Cannons. The Spanish will use Transports if they cannot attack from the land."

You can click on signs for directions."

61909 "<RED>Frankish Soldier: The Moslems have destroyed one of our Town Centers. The rest of the city is sure to fall!"
61910 "<RED>Frankish Soldier: We have reached Poitiers! The Moslem baggage train is protected inside. If we can capture it, they will retreat back from whence they came."

Charles Martel's army is to south of the city. \n\n There are two armies of Moslems; the Berbers (yellow) occupy the western edge of the map. They train Light Cavalry, swordsmen, and rams, but their town is not well-defended and could fall to an early attack. \n\n The Moors (green) have occupied the city of Poitiers to the southwest, making their army harder to defeat. They train Camels, Knights, and Scorpions, but will switch to Mamelukes given enough time."

62010 "<RED>Viking: Hear that howl? That one's the king of the wolves. He can take down an army of our Norsemen."
62011 "<RED>Viking: The British keep their gold in these Markets. Burn all you can and carry the gold back to our ships."
62012 "<RED>Viking: Legends have spoken of this place, the Sea of Worms! The waters here be alive and eager to chew through the hulls of our Longships. We should sail clear of this place, even if it means crossing Greenland by foot."

62016 "<RED>Viking: The name of Erik the Red will never be forgotten as the first Viking in the New World!"
62017 "<RED>Viking: To establish our settlement here, we will need to construct a Town Center, a Market, and 12 Houses."
62018 "<RED>Viking: Without Erik the Red, we will never reach the New World."
62019 "<GREEN>Viking: You wish to see the Sea of Worms? Look upon it and despair!"
62020 "Your scouts report: The Vikings under Erik the Red (red) have few buildings and only a handful of Berserks to defend themselves from ravenous wolves. Although you are safe from attack for the moment, Vikings from Greenland may raid your shores. \n\n The British (blue) have little in the way of a standing army so they are ripe for raiding. \n\n Greenland (green) is more of a mystery, though it is known that the Vikings there have many Longships. \n\n A race of wildmen (purple) are rumored to live in the New World."

62108 "<ORANGE>Harold the Saxon: You Viking scum forget how to fight this far inland!"
62109 "<AQUA>Harald Hardraade: William! Old Harold the Saxon's smashed my forces at Stamford Bridge. My Vikings will keep fighting, but you'll have to come here and transport them across yourself."

62111 "<ORANGE>Harold the Saxon: Come down off those horses and see how Huskarls fight man to man!"
62112 "<BLUE>Norman Knight: The Saxons have the British Isles well fortified. We'll need to transport our Knights across the channel and use them to defend our builders. Norman Castles should hold back the Saxon tide both here and on Britain."

62115 "Your scouts report: The Normans (blue) have a large town established in France. Their lands should be free of enemy marauders, but Harold's Raiders (yellow) could attack at any moment. \n\n The Saxon Navy (red) will try to repel any Norman Transports or warships that threaten Harold's Army (orange). You can try to defeat the Saxon Navy's shipyards to the north and south before laying siege to Harold the Saxon's Castle near London. \n\n The Vikings under Harald Hardraade (cyan) are a wildcard.

Do not destroy many buildings of the Byzantine Themes or you will have less to use once they are conquered. \n\n 3. This battle takes place centuries before the discovery of gunpowder. \n\n 4. Garrisoned Battering Rams are useful for taking out enemy gates and towers."

62214 "<PURPLE>Seljuk Rider: We can capture this by destroying the towers protecting it. Then the villagers will produce gold for the Turks!"
62215 "<PURPLE>Seljuk Rider: With this gold, we can train many more horse archers."
62216 "<PURPLE>Seljuk Rider: We have captured Cappadocia. As long as their villagers are safe, we should have all the resources we need."
62217 "<PURPLE>Seljuk Rider: This town will produce gold coin for us now, as long as we can keep the Byzantines from taking it back."
62218 "<PURPLE>Seljuk Rider: Those Cataphracts pack quite a punch. Better to fire and retreat than face them toe-to-toe."
62219 "<PURPLE>Seljuk Rider: The Byzantine army is fortified atop this plateau. We must be patient until we have the troops we need to conquer it."

You can, however, train additional units. \n\n Additional resources and buildings can be gained by conquering the three Byzantine Themes (towns) of Cappadocia, Pisidia, and Galatia and the Saracen (cyan) gold mines. However, you must defeat -- not conquer -- the Byzantine army. \n\n The Byzantine Themes rely largely on walls and towers for defenses.  The Byzantine Army is a different story.

62307 "King Henry V must return home to England."
62308 "OPTIONAL: Destroy the University in Voyeni (green) to recover and learn from the great texts stored there."

62311 "<RED>English Soldier: We'll see how these French knights stand up to English Longbows!"
62312 "<RED>English Soldier: My King, the siege of Harfleur is lost! We should withdraw before our casualties are too grave!"
62313 "<RED>English Soldier: The French will undoubtedly harry our retreat -- we must make haste to a Transport that our King Henry will once again see beloved England!"
62314 "<RED>English Soldier: It is as I feared -- this bridge has been destroyed."
62315 "<RED>English Soldier: We may just be able to slip between these cliffs and the walls of Voyeni. However, Voyeni is known for its learning -- perhaps we can recover something from the University there."
62316 "<RED>English Soldier: We have recovered Greek Fire -- let us apply it to our arrows and rain fire on the French!"
62317 "<RED>English Soldier: Those are the gates that protect Amiens. The town is known for its smithing -- we could try to recover some of their handiwork from the Blacksmith there."
62318 "<RED>English Soldier: We have recovered armor for our swordsmen, knights and archers, as well as fine blades and arrowheads!"
62319 "<RED>English Soldier: The nearby town of Frevent is quiet and peaceful; we should be able to rest here, but not for too long."
62320 "<RED>English Soldier: The Castle of Agincourt lies down this road. We will likely face many French Knights. The fighting will be fierce!"

62327 "<RED>English Soldier: North along the road, men! North and then west to the Docks!"
62328 "<BLUE>French Knight: Come down here in the mud and you will see how the French knights fight!"

62330 "<RED>Henry V: Today is Saint Crispian's day, and every year from now on you will be able to show your scars and say that you were here with me on Saint Crispian's day. He today who sheds his blood with me shall be my brother."
62331 "Your scouts report: The English (red) must navigate or conquer several French towns before they can return home. Harfleur (purple) is in the southwest, Amiens (cyan) is atop a cliffed plateau in the south, Voyeni (green) is in the center of the area, Frevent (yellow) is to the southeast, and French Knights (blue) roam the north. \n\n England lies to the northwest, across the English channel. You will need Transports to reach it. \n\n Bridges are out or heavily fortified down most of the length of the River Somme, but there may be an undefended crossing further southeast."

62402 "Greek Village"
62403 "1. Do not use all of your villagers to construct the Wonder. You will need some to gather resources and to repair walls, towers, and ships. \n\n 2. It is very difficult to go offensive against the Turkish fleet. Concentrate on defenses instead. \n\n 3. Greek isles hold additional resources, if you can defend them…."
62404 "Complete and then defend your Wonder from the Turkish navy for 200 years."
62405 "OPTIONAL: Tribute the Greeks (green) 800 gold so they will ally with you."
62406 "<RED>Spanish Navy: There's hundreds of Turkish ships out there. We don't have the numbers to go offensive, so we should just keep their Galleons and Transports at bay."
62407 "<RED>Spanish Navy: Turkish Transports! Don't let them land!"
62408 "<RED>Spanish Navy: The Wonder is in jeopardy! Save it if you can!"
62409 "<RED>Spanish Navy: It is dangerous to sail too far into the jaws of the Turkish fleet. We're better off patrolling our own shores."
62410 "<RED>Spanish Navy: Our Fire Ships will sink the Turkish fleet to the bottom of the Ionian Sea!"
62411 "<RED>Spanish Navy: The Wonder is complete. Now we just need to defend it."
62412 "<RED>Spanish Navy: Why did our brilliant leaders insist on building the Wonder so close to the shoreline?"
62413 "<GREEN>Greek Villager: I do not think we would fare well under Turkish rule. If you tribute to us 800 gold, we will ally with you instead."
62414 "<GREEN>Greek Villager: Ah, it is prudent for us to join forces againt the Turks. You may mine gold from our villagers or islands and we will tribute you what we can spare."
62415 "Your scouts report: Don Juan's Spanish and Italian fleet (red) has abandoned the sea to build a Wonder on the beach. \n\n They must defend it from the warships and Transports of Ottoman Turks (purple). The Turks use a variety of different ships, including Cannon Galleons, and will attempt to transport Janissaries and Bombard Cannons across the sea. However, quick counterattacks against the Turks may slow their progress. \n\n The Greek villages (green) are caught in the middle of the battle, but might join you if presented with the right opportunity."

62505 "1. Some of your Samurai are in Kyoto with Lord Nobunaga. They will not be able to escape on their own, but they can attempt to protect Nobunaga. \n\n 2. Defeat the garrison at Osaka and establish your own town in its place. Do not wantonly destroy buildings, or you will have to rebuild much once you capture Osaka. \n\n 3. Although a direct assault on Kyoto can be succesful, sneak attacks may yield fewer casualties. \n\n 4. Rebel Monks in Kyoto are actively searching for Relics. Do not allow them such a victory!"
62506 "Your lord, Nobunaga, is trapped in Kyoto. You must rescue him to restore his honor."
62507 "Establish a base from which to attack Kyoto."
62508 "Destroy all 3 of Kyoto's Castles to punish them for the murder of Lord Nobunaga."

62510 "<AQUA>Hideyoshi's Soldier: Lord Nobunaga is in Kyoto. We must rescue him to restore his honor."
62511 "<YELLOW>Nobunaga's Sailor: We will send in saboteurs to open that wall."

62515 "<AQUA>Hideyoshi's Soldier: Lord Hideyoshi has cast down another enemy. Soon, all of Japan will be unified under a single leader and we can be done with these civil wars forever!"
62516 "<AQUA>Hideyoshi's Soldier: This village will be causing us no more grief."
62517 "Your scouts report: Hideyoshi's forces (cyan) begin on board Lord Nobunaga's ships. After you invade Osaka, you will need to quickly neutralize resistance and establish a base. \n\n There are three enemies in this region. Osaka (red) has walls and Castles, but has a small standing army. Hyogo (blue) is a relatively small village. An early strike can eliminate this threat, but Hyogo will eventually attack with infantry, archers and Samurai if allowed to build unchecked. \n\n Kyoto (green) is the most dangerous enemy, as the city is well-defended and there are many Spearmen, Samurai and Knights defending the Castles. Kyoto may also build a navy if given the opportunity."

The Koreans are unable to construct Castles or train some of their most powerful units, at least initially."
62606 "Defend Korea from the Japanese. \n\n OPTIONAL: Prevent the Japanese from destroying Korea's Wonder."
62607 "Defend Korea from the Japanese."

62611 "Use Turtle Ships to defeat the Japanese navy."
62612 "<RED>Korean Sailor: Korea is free once again!"
62613 "<RED>Korean Soldier: We cannot drive off the repeated attacks of these Japanese warships. We must seek aid from Admiral Yi Sun Shin. Rumor has it that he has been working on a secret weapon."
62614 "<RED>Korean Soldier: With these Turtle Ships, we will send every Japanese ship to the bottom of the sea! We should build as many as we can."
62615 "<RED>Korean Sailor: Our coast is now rid of Japanese marauders, but they could return in the future. We should sail to Japan and destroy all of the Japanese Docks."
62616 "<ORANGE>Chinese Chu Ko Nu: Admiral Yi, we can assist you in driving off the Japanese raiders, but you will have to transport us across the sea."
62617 "Your scouts report: Korea (red) has an extensive town, but is vulnerable to the Japanese navy, particularly its Cannon Galleons. \n\n Expect Japan (yellow) to attack with everything they have, including ships and Samurai on Transports. You will need to play defensively until you have the means to bring the battle back to the Japanese homeland. \n\n Two potential allies may be found. Admiral Yi (green) is a brilliant Korean tactician who will certainly assist, provided you can locate him. \n\n The Chinese (orange) are no friends of Korea, but they may fear the Japanese even more.

63087 "NOTE: Sometimes, to begin a dialogue, you will have to select another unit. The objectives will prompt you when this is the case.\n\n1. You will have a fixed amount of troops for the majority of the scenario and will not receive many reinforcements. Carefully manage the troops that you have, and guard your precious siege weapons.\n\n2. As with any battle, tactics are important. Use uphill advantage and proper counter-units when possible. Pikemen are more effective against cavalry than archers or swordsmen, and Cataphracts are good all-around troops that are especially deadly to infantry. Luring tactics are also effective against superior forces.\n\n3. When besieging Lombard-controlled Bari, time is of the essence. Your besieging army has the upper hand, but the Lombards will overpower you if you wait too long.\n\n4. Bari has multiple entrances, and besieged cities do not have the supplies to rebuild their buildings.\n\n5. Panos Nautikos and his forces may reach the Imperial Age."
63088 "Your scouts report:\n\nPanos begins the scenario in an unnamed port, somewhere in Byzantium (Yellow). Soon he will join a large Byzantine fleet sent towards Bari.\n\nIn the center of the map is Bari (Red) , a major city and the object of your conquest. It is surrounded by a moat, extensive fortifications, a strong harbor, and defended by many Arab (Green) swordsmen and cavalry.\n\nThe road southwest of Bari leads to Louis' camp (Orange) on the beach, near the hostile town of Matera (Purple). Matera is defended by walls, a castle, towers, a small garrison, and a contingent of Arab cavalry.\n\nWest of Bari and north of Matera is an open countryside where bandits and brigands run wild.\n\nNorth of Bari and northeast of the countryside is the city of Oria (Cyan), which is occupied by the Emirate (Green). They yearn to join the Christian cause.\n\n-Northeast of Bari and southeast of Oria is a Byzantine encampment (Yellow)  containing a sizable army.\n\nThe Lombards (Grey) are the most dangerous opponent. When defending Bari, they will train droves of infantry and archers, supported by Monks and knights, and they will even sally forth with trebuchets."
63089 "Panos must survive."
63090 "1. Unload all Byzantine troops at the camp of Louis II and array them in formation there, for Louis wants to address the troops. Once all men have disembarked and assembled, select Louis II (orange cavalier).\n\nYou must destroy any Arab ships in the area. Scout around."
63091 "2. Bring the messenger (and only the messenger) to the gates of Matera to offer terms of surrender. If the Materans see other troops, they will think it is an attack."
63092 "3. Sack Matera by destroying all buildings there except houses."
63093 "4. Bring Panos to Louis, who is waiting just outside the destroyed gate of Matera, and select the Emperor to speak to him."
63094 "5. Take the east road from Matera and travel to Oria. Liberate Oria by killing all enemy troops inside the city."
63095 "6. Descend upon the countryside to the southwest and slay every Arab rider you find! Search the area thoroughly and clear all of the roads as well! Once you have slain them all, return to Oria's lord."
63096 "7. Bring Panos back to Louis' camp to report the victory at Oria and receive further orders from Louis."
63097 "8. Sail to Bari harbor and destroy all docks, ships, and towers there, in order to cut the enemy's supplies. Try not to lose any transport ships; you will need them later. Once done, return to Louis."
63098 "9. Go to the castle of Oria, where the sapper is waiting for you."
63099 "10. Bring the sapper to the weak spot in the wall."
63100 "11. Panos' men have breached the walls of Bari. The Barians are Christian and not hostile towards you but you must cleanse the city of the occupying Arab troops to conquer it.\n\nIn other words: Defeat the Emirate of Bari."
63101 "12. Bring Louis to Bari Castle.\n\nNote: Now that the city has fallen, the gates in the harbor are now open."
63102 "13. Bring Panos to the commander of the Byzantine camp to the east."
63103 "14. Destroy the five castles defending Bari so the Byzantines can conquer the city."

63589 "<GREEN>THEIGN: You will have to be cautious. I will sneak through the mountains to the other village, but my men will help you fight. Good luck!"
63590 "Select Michael to continue."
63591 "<BLUE>MICHAEL: Onwards!"
63592 "6. Bring Michael to the Norman town of Capua and meet with its lord to ask for help."
63593 "<BLUE>MICHAEL: Friend, we flee the rebellion of Melus in Bari. Will you help us defeat him?"
63594 "<GREY>NORMAN: We will help you, but we need something in return. A pilgrim convoy carrying a sacred relic was ambushed by rebels in the swamp. If you bring this relic to our church, we will join you. Our town priest and some men will accompany you."

63596 "7. Bring the relic in the swamp to Capua's church."

63605 "<BLUE>MICHAEL: Let's build up an army quickly! Once he finds our town, Melus will attack!"
63606 "<GREEN>CHIEFTAIN: Ah, Michael, you are back, and fighting Melus this time. If you build a tower near the beach to defend us from Melus, we will help you fight him."

Andreas Nautikos will have access to all of the finest soldiers that Bari has to offer- Tagmata (Two-handed swordsmen), Varangians (Halberdiers), Crossbowmen, Elite skirmishers, Light Cavalry, Knights, certain siege units, and some ships."
64004 "Your scouts report:\n\nAndreas Nautikos is being briefed by the catepan of Bari, Stephanos Pateranos.\n\nThe city of Bari (Purple) is a bustling harbor city on the Adriatic coast, but is currently besieged by vast armies of Normans.\n\nThe Normans (Grey) are your most dangerous opponent. They have encircled the city of Bari with several camps, and will attack with droves of swordsmen, crossbowmen, skirmishers, spearmen, siege, and their fearsome knights.\n\nThe Adriatic sea is a good potential escape route from Bari, but the waters outside Bari are patrolled by several Norman vessels."

64104 "<PURPLE>LOUKAS PROCOPIUS: Have my trebuchet? What for?"
64105 "<BLUE>ANDREAS: I don't know if you happened to notice, but the Normans have the city surrounded. Your trebuchet would be a valuable asset in taking down an important enemy position."
64106 "<PURPLE>LOUKAS PROCOPIUS: I'm not going to hand it over to the first person who asks. Unless..."
64107 "<PURPLE>LOUKAS PROCOPIUS: One of my trade vessels has crashed into a nearby sandbank a couple of weeks ago. If you bring it back for me, the trebuchet is yours."
64108 "<PURPLE>LOUKAS PROCOPIUS: All I can spare to aid you in this task is this ship. My assistant Cranos will guide you through the process."

64110 "<BLUE>ANDREAS: Very well. Let's go!"
64111 "<BLUE>CRANOS: The ship has been repaired. Time to get out of here!"

64114 "<PURPLE>LOUKAS PROCOPIUS: You can have my trebuchet, as promised."
64115 "<PURPLE>LOUKAS PROCOPIUS: The Normans are attacking the docks. Run!"
64116 "<BLUE>ANDREAS: Good to know this trebuchet functions properly."
64117 "<PURPLE>LOUKAS PROCOPIUS: I had work to do here, I was not being slothful. Don't look at me like that..."
64118 "11. Destroy the incoming Norman ships."
64119 "<BLUE>ANDREAS: Let's bring this trebuchet to the Catepan."
64120 "12. Bring Andreas and the trebuchet to Stephanos Pateranos."
64121 "<PURPLE>TAGMATA CAPTAIN: You again? ...Where did you get that siege weapon from?"
64122 "<BLUE>ANDREAS: A trader gave it to me for running an errand for him. I heard we need to neutralize a Norman tower and I thought it would be just the tool for the job."
64123 "<PURPLE>TAGMATA CAPTAIN: Didn't know it was the season for trebuchets... But anyway, I fear it's too risky to use this device. It's seen some years and I don't feel like facing the Catepan's wrath in case we fail."
64124 "<BLUE>ANDREAS: So you prefer to sit here and twiddle your thumbs? I doubt that'll make the Catepan any happier..."
64125 "<PURPLE>TAGMATA CAPTAIN: If you so insist... I would advise setting it up near our walls. This will force the Normans to come in the range of our towers to try and dismantle it."
64126 "You will lose if the trebuchet gets destroyed."
64127 "<BLUE>ANDREAS: NO! The trebuchet!"
64128 "13. Destroy the Norman tower."
64129 "<PURPLE>STEPHANOS PATERANOS: What? An attack? I have not commenced any attack!"
64130 "<BLUE>SOLDIER: The Normans are counterattacking!"
64131 "<BLUE>ANDREAS: The streets sure are empty... Several have somehow escaped the city walls, many more have fought to their deaths and the rest dares not leave their homes. At times like this I reminisce of the days of prosperity..."
64132 "Nordic Swordsman"
64133 "<BLUE>SOLDIER: Our Catepan is in danger! We must come to his aid!"
64134 "14. Normans are attacking Stephanos Pateranos from behind. Prevent him from getting killed."
64135 "<BLUE>SOLDIER: Our Catepan has been killed!"
64136 "<BLUE>SAILOR: The sea is ours again! Full assault!"
64137 "<BLUE>SAILOR: The Normans are sending more ships to reinforce their docks!"
64138 "15. Destroy the two Norman docks."
64139 "Finally :p"
64140 "<BLUE>ANDREAS: Now that the Norman ships are preoccupied with our fleet, it would probably be best to leave the city by sea."
64141 "<BLUE>ANDREAS: I fear Michael was right. Bari will soon fall because of the sheer amount of Normans. We do not have enough men to keep the Normans at bay for long anymore."
64142 "16. Head to the docks of Bari."
64143 "<PURPLE>LOUKAS PROCOPIUS: Ah, I see you still draw breath. How fares my trebuchet?"
64144 "<BLUE>ANDREAS: It pulled us through. I was wondering what you were doing here, sir Procopius."
64145 "<PURPLE>LOUKAS PROCOPIUS:  I was thinking of, uh... paying my family back in Greece a visit. It seemed like the right time, now that the Norman fleet is, well, preoccupied."
64146 "<BLUE>ANDREAS: Mind if I join you?"
64147 "<PURPLE>LOUKAS PROCOPIUS: Of course I don't mind! Without Cranos around, I could really use an extra pair of arms."
64148 "<BLUE>ANDREAS: I thought I was missing someone. Where is he now?"
64149 "<PURPLE>LOUKAS PROCOPIUS: He's off waging war with the Normans. He is a sailor, after all."
64150 "<PURPLE>LOUKAS PROCOPIUS: But enough chatter. All aboard!"
64151 "<BLUE>LOUKAS PROCOPIUS: Let us go! Mind the sandbanks though..."
64152 "<BLUE>ANDREAS: Norman galleys are upon us!"
64153 "17. Sail to freedom."
64154 "Loukas Procopius must survive and the transport ship must not be destroyed."
64155 "<BLUE>ANDREAS: We must lose those tailing galleys first!"
64156 "Andreas must survive."

64507 "1. You can click on the local people (Red) to ask them about the countryside. Some will give you valuable information, while others are blatant liars.\n\n2. During some missions, you will need to protect specific units. You need a cart to pick up hay, and a monk to heal the injured man in the fortress. If either of these units die, you will lose.\n\n3. You will control a limited number of units for the entire scenario and will only receive reinforcements upon completing missions. Therefore, properly managing your troops is crucial.\n\n4. Some quests will have to be completed before others. For example, you can only use the water from Luigeusi's aqueduct after proving your mettle to him.\n\n5. Carmagnola's fortress in the west is well-guarded and should be avoided before you have united all of the captains under one banner."
64508 "Your scouts report:\n\nA Company of condottieri under the Sforzas are marching west to attack Carmagnola, but first need a way to ford the river.\n\nVillagers in the small town (Red) know the lay of the land, and are sure to be of some help.\n\nThe condottiero bands have camped out in the countryside:\n\n-Captain Johannes (Yellow) has taken up camp slightly west of the local village.\n\n-Captain Bontolmo (Cyan) has taken residence in an abandoned fortress to the north of a swamp.\n\n-Captain Luiguesi (Purple) has camped with his siege near the eastern cliffs.\n\n-Captain Marcelo (Grey) has taken residence around an old watchtower to the east of the village.\n\n-Captain Guitano (Orange) and his cavalry have taken up camp in an old barn to the south of the swamp.\n\nRaiders (Green) in the pay of Carmagnola have poured out of their fortress in the west of the map and now pillage the countryside. Their infantry, archers, and light cavalry should be no match for a strong condottiero force, but the fortress will require siege weapons to breach."

64520 "<BLUE>FRANCESCO SFORZA: Father, one of the captains is being too soft on the men... giving them one and a half rations, giving them breaks on the march...it is only murmurs but what should we do about this?"
64521 "<RED>MUZIO SFORZA: We will speak of this later, we must focus on marching. However, I do want to know which bastard is letting my men go soft. Keep your eyes open and be wary."
64522 "<RED>MUZIO SFORZA: We must keep marching!"
64523 "<RED>MUZIO SFORZA: Hmph. The scouts said this river would be flooded. No matter. If we are cautious enough, we can cross here!"
64524 "<BLUE>FRANCESCO SFORZA: Should we even attempt the river at all? There is a ford to the southwest."
64525 "<RED>MUZIO SFORZA: Francesco! You have two options: Grow up, or be a craven coward and cross down there. I will cross here!"

64530 "<YELLOW>JOHANNES: I'm sorry, but he was wearing plate armor... and you saw how fast the current was moving... I'm sorry sir. He was a great commander, if a bit hard. However..."
64531 "<BLUE>FRANCESCO SFORZA: However what? We still have our contract! We have to keep going. I will take charge of the Brigata!"
64532 "<YELLOW>JOHANNES: None of the captains are bound to service after the commander dies. Unless you can prove your worth, we're gone. If you fail we don't get paid. Again, sorry for your loss..."
64533 "<BLUE>FRANCESCO SFORZA: Well, I guess I'll have to prove myself to them."
64534 "<BLUE>FRANCESCO SFORZA: Hey, the rain stopped..."
64535 "1. Convince all the captains to rejoin."
64536 "<YELLOW>JOHANNES: So you wish to prove yourself, huh? Well, I never thought you a great fighter. Kill the bandit leader on the road directly west, and I'll rejoin you."
64537 "-Kill the bandit leader west of Johannes' camp and return with evidence of his death."
64538 "<YELLOW>JOHANNES: Good job Sforza! You did it! Fighting is not your only weakness; the other captains will tell you. But I felt it was your greatest and you overcame it. Here are the men I promised."
64539 "<AQUA>BONTOLMO: Ah! Francesco! ....hmmm...you might be able to help me. My second in command is dying in the fortress and he needs a healer! If you can find one, I will rejoin you."
64540 "-Find a monk and bring him to Bontolmo's fortress."
64541 "<BLUE>FRANCESCO SFORZA: Healer! I am in need of your assistance! A man is dying!"
64542 "<AQUA>BONTOLMO: Thank you Sforza! Here are some men. I always thought you were too slow to make decisions unlike your father. Muzio was far too tough, though. Learn from his good traits and bad!"
64543 "<PURPLE>LUIGEUSI: So you want my siege back, eh Sforza? Prove you can help me. You never learned to salvage food and weapons from scraps because Muzio coddled you (but nobody else). We need five wheels."
64544 "-Find 5 downed carts and bring the wheels back to Luigeusi."
64545 "-WHEEL FOUND-"
64546 "-ALL 5 WHEELS FOUND-"
64547 "<PURPLE>LUIGEUSI: Hah! I was wrong, you've learned hard work! Or you purchased these wheels. Smart either way! Here's the siege I promised. You can also use this aqueduct if you like."
64548 "<ORANGE>GUITANO: Muzio sometimes tested our patience with him. If only he could see us now, drinking swamp water. If you can find us fresh water, that is all I need to rejoin the Brigata."
64549 "-Retrieve water for Guitano's horses."
64550 "<BLUE>FRANCESCO SFORZA: This is the purest water I've ever tasted!"
64551 "<ORANGE>GUITANO: Ahhh, Sforza. You considered my request and swiftly granted it. You are more even-tempered than your father. I will rejoin the Brigata. Take some of my men with you."
64552 "<GREY>MARCELO: The Brigata is broken, Sforza. I will be blunt: I do not like you. I think you are arrogant. If you can do a humble man's work and put hay into this cart for our horses, I will rejoin."
64553 "-Find 6 stacks of hay for Marcelo's horses."
64554 "<GREY>CART DRIVER: Sir! We're full. Where to now?"
64555 "<GREY>MARCELO: Ah, you are not the arrogant little boy I thought you to be. I am humble enough to recognize that you are a grown man, worthy of following. Take some of my men!"
64556 "<YELLOW>JOHANNES: Sforza, you've done a great job in reassuring all of the Captains. If you can do one more thing the Brigata will be yours: destroy the bandit fortress guarding the ford far to the west."
64557 "<AQUA>BONTOLMO: Sforza, you are quick-witted and I respect that. You know we still have a mission. My scout say that far to the west is a bandit fortress guarding the ford. Destroy it!"
64558 "<PURPLE>LUIGEUSI: Heh heh heh, Sforza! You are my leader! There is a bandit fortress far to the west! Use my beautiful machines to destroy it so we can cross the ford and get our money!"
64559 "<GREY>MARCELO: The entire Brigata is under your command, but there's always money. We must finish our mission. To do so, destroy the bandit fortress blocking the ford. It is located in the west."
64560 "<ORANGE>GUITANO: I am sure you will take my counsel, young Sforza. The ford to the northwest of here is guarded by a bandit fortress. Destroy it so the Brigata...your Brigata may cross."
64561 "2. Destroy Carmagnola's castle to the west."
64562 "<BLUE>CONDOTTIERI: We are victorious! Thanks be to the Lord!"
64563 "<YELLOW>JOHANNES: I pledge myself to you and your banner."
64564 "<AQUA>BONTOLMO: I will follow you, Francesco Sforza. You are a worthy leader!"
64565 "<PURPLE>LUIGEUSI: Francseco, you are imponente! We follow Francesco Sforza!"
64566 "<GREY>MARCELO: Your father was a great man, and you will follow in his footsteps, as I will follow in yours."
64567 "<ORANGE>GUITANO: As long as you allow us to be your counsel, you will be successful!"
64568 "<BLUE>FRANCESCO SFORZA: Father, I will make you proud."
64569 "Francesco Sforza must survive."

64583 "<RED>VILLAGER: There's a broken cart just east of the farms."
64584 "<RED>VILLAGER: Man, all this hay everywhere. I even went down next to that old barn where the Condottieri cavalry are, and there was some to the east of them!"
64585 "<RED>VILLAGER: All the water round here is bad, save for the aqueduct water. The river water has debris from upstream cause of the flooding, and the stream water from the swamp is all brackish."

65017 "<YELLOW>VISCONTI: ...Sforza...where have you been? Seeing if the Florentines can make you a better offer?"
65018 "<YELLOW>VISCONTI: Hmph, nevermind. Take this payment, and use our market to feed your troops if needed. "

65026 "3. Raid Tuscany: destroy the 4 outlying Town Centers and 25 other buildings."
65027 "<BLUE>SFORZA: We've dirsupted the Florentine economy enough. Let us head back to Piacenza."
65028 "<BLUE>SFORZA: We've destroyed about 10 buildings. 15 more and the Florentines will be thoroughly terrorized."

65038 "<BLUE>SFORZA: Captain, most of the Venetians sailed right past us towards Pavia. We must warn the duke. They're going for a direct assault on Milan!!!"
65039 "<YELLOW>CAPTAIN: Unfortunately my hands are tied. The Venetian leader Carmagnola is besieging Pizzighettone to the north. We've strict orders to intercept any of his reinforcements."

65043 "2. Eliminate Carmagnola's reinforcement troops. Do not allow them to get past the walls of Cremona."
65044 "<BLUE>SFORZA: That's settled. Let's hope Pizzighettone can withstand the siege while we warn the duke."
65045 "<YELLOW>WATCH: Alarm!"
65046 "3. Bring Sforza back to Milan to report to Duke Visconti."
65047 "<YELLOW>VISCONTI: What?! I've sent Malatesta with all our forces northwards, to protect the crossing at Pizzighettone. We're defenseless against an attack from the river!"
65048 "<BLUE>SFORZA: Then the Venetian deception has worked. But not all is lost, my duke. Give me command of Milan's defenses! I will not fail you."
65049 "The Venetian fleet will arrive in 6 minutes."
65050 "The Venetian fleet will arrive in 3 minutes."

65062 "<AQUA>MALATESTA: It worked! Those Venetian dogs retreat with their tails between their legs. Let's chase them down!"
65063 "<AQUA>MALATESTA: Haha, they entered the swamp. Fools! We have them now. Show no mercy, men."
65064 "<ORANGE>CARMAGNOLA: Fire!"
65065 "<AQUA>MALATESTA: Wait... What?!"
65066 "<BLUE>SFORZA: There's something off. Those bandits looked...Venetian... We'd better get straight to Piacenza."

65071 "<AQUA>SERGEANT: Halt! Pizzighettone is under siege. The bridge has to stay clear for when we need a swift retreat."
65072 "<BLUE>SFORZA: We're not equipped for a full Siege, so stay away from their town."
65073 "<BLUE>SFORZA: Visconti, I just came from Cremona. The Venetians never meant to take it. They're heading straight for Milan!"

Your units travel in fog of war. if they are in the light, you are likely seen by a guard.\n\n3. Your units are difficult to select with one click. Drag a box around them - this always works.\n\n4. When you are approached by a guard, you have just under 5 seconds to kill the guard before the alarm is sounded. Once the alarm is sounded, the guards will rush to where you are.\n\n5. Do not walk into the blackness.\n\n6. Onagers can cut down trees, especially in opportune areas to set up defenses.\n\n7. The area is very low on Stone, you have no access to warships. You must rely on flesh and blood troops to counter the enemy ships. Instead of building 5 towers, build 1 tower and garrison it with 5 Arbalests.\n\n8. Genoese Crossbowmen have an attack bonus vs Galleons as well as higher HPs and pierce armor, and it may be worth it to sacrifice some extra defenses to build a Castle.\n\n9.

65557 "<BLUE>GEREMIO: I don't feel too good about it because this aqueduct is for the village here but we can rebuild it. If we destroy it now, Carmagnola's men will go into battle thirsty!"

65559 "<BLUE>SIMONE: Okay. Done."

65575 "<BLUE>SFORZA: It's good to see you two. We have to get ready for the Venetian assault. How long will it take?"
65577 "<BLUE>GEREMIO: About 20 minutes from now. But thanks to our dastardly deeds, Carmagnola will sit across the river in his gigantic camp so we can create a defense force unhurried."
65578 "<BLUE>SIMONE: Heh, he thinks we're going to be marching on his camp by land. He's going to watch helplessly as we smash the Venetians on the rocks!"
65579 "<BLUE>SFORZA: We have to scout the river and set up defenses on the islands."
65580 "<BLUE>SFORZA: Venetian ships incoming!"
65581 "<BLUE>SFORZA: And here comes the Milanese fleet! We cannot allow them to be defeated, or else the Venetians can invade the heart of Milan again."
65582 "<ORANGE>CARMAGNOLA: You're a sly one, Sforza. You've managed to survive so far, but my army is ready for you. Come at me with the best you got and you'll see how a real Carmagnola fights!"

65586 "<BLUE>SFORZA: We will run out of gold here soon. We should probably build a Market and trade with the small Milanese town here."

66008 "Your scouts report:\n\nFrancesco Sforza's army of condottieri is camped to the northwest and has orders to conquer the treacherous towns who joined Venice. Pavia (Red) is the first on the road- they are still neutral to you and can be persuaded peacefully to join you. Cremona (Yellow) is in the south and is your only unwavering ally. You can buy mercenaries from there but also have to protect them from Venice. The locals (Orange) are friendly but also there are hostile rebels (Gray).\n\nPiacenza (Green) lies southeast of Pavia and is hostile to you, but it has a small garrison and can be easilly overrun if it's defences are breached. Caravaggio (Cyan) is located to the north, with a strong garrison and could rely on direct support from the Venetian army as well.

It's not a bad idea to save on a regular basis.\n\n4. Protect your hero! It is better to keep him somewhere in a building in your base than to let him wander off and get killed.\n\n5. Your main competitor for resources on the map is Abbiategrasso. You should attack them as early as possible."

67027 "<ORANGE>Gonzalo Pizarro: I knew I could count on you, kinsman! But there is one problem. Diaz de Pineda is already preparing an expedition to El Dorado. Perhaps you can 'persuade' him to join us? *Winks*"
67028 "<BLUE>Francisco de Orellana: What did you have in mind?"
67029 "<ORANGE>Gonzalo Pizarro: First, kill his sergeants. Then bribe his merchants. Sabotage his preparations until he becomes desperate. However, avoid an open conflict with Pineda and his guards."
67030 "3. Visit Carlos the merchant."
67031 "<YELLOW>Carlos the Merchant: Maria, your hair is so soft and your lips are so sweet. But, unfortunately, I must return to my uncomely wife."

67038 "<BLUE>Francisco de Orellana: I have seen enough to know that a certain shipment to Diaz de Pineda will be cancelled. Otherwise, your wife will be pleased to hear about the sweet lips of Maria!"
67039 "<YELLOW>Carlos the Merchant: You scumbag! I will cut your tongue before you can tell her. Guards, grab him!"

67043 "5. Go back to Gonzalo."
67044 "<ORANGE>Gonzalo Pizarro: Ah, Francisco. I knew you would not let me down! In fact, I am promoting you to second in command. I will make way to the Sumaco valley. Assemble your army and join me there."
67045 "<BLUE>Francisco de Orellana: We have enough men and we are ready to join the expedition."
67046 "8. Gather all your men and go to the Sumaco Valley, located east of Quito, to find Pizzaro's camp."
67047 "<BLUE>Francisco de Orellana: Hmm, it seems this town is abandoned, we are safe here. Reports tell us that there is a large army of rebels hidden nearby. Scouts, go to Gonzalo's camp and ask for a relief party."
67048 "<BLUE>Scout: Don't worry, amigo. This cliff is crossable and it is perfectly safe."
67049 "9. Bring at least one of your scouts to Gonzalo."
67050 "<BLUE> Francisco de Orellana: The rebel army is attacking us! Quickly fortify this abandoned town and prepare to fend off their attacks!"

67052 "<BLUE>Francisco de Orellana: We've defeated them, they're running away! Let's regroup and wait for Gonzalo to arrive."
67053 "<BLUE>Gonzalo Pizarro: Francisco! Your scouts told me that you got attacked by an army of rebels! Are you hurt?"
67054 "<BLUE>Francisco de Orellana: No, I'm fine. I never thought natives could assemble such a large army in such a short time."
67055 "<BLUE>Gonzalo Pizzaro: I've enslaved many of them, now we have men to carry our supplies through the rain forest and we're ready for our journey. On to El Dorado!"

67563 "<GREEN>Chief: I am sorry, but we do not have time to chat. The enemy tribe will attack us any time. Mmm, you have much better equipment. You could defeat them. Their camp is to the north. Destroy it, and I will help you."
67564 " - Second Chief (Elite Eagle Warrior): Destroy the camp of the enemy tribe."
67565 "<GREEN>Chief: Thank you. In gratitude I will answer your question. I have heard about wealthy kingdoms further down the river. One of them is even ruled by women. Do not underestimate them- they fight more fiercely than most men!"
67566 "<GREEN>Chief: Greetings, outlanders. First you must help us. You ride four-legged beasts, thus you are able to move much faster. Someone has broken our llama pen. Bring back our twelve llamas to the pen and repair the fence. Then I will help you gladly."
67567 " - Third Chief (Kamayuk): Bring back 12 llamas to their pen and rebuild the missing palisade."
67568 "<GREEN>Chief: Thank you very much for returning our llamas. Regarding your question: if you plan to navigate the river down-stream, you better brace up your ship to withstand the attack of hostile tribes."
67569 "<BLUE>Francisco de Orellana: We have drifted too far away from my uncle. We cannot navigate the river up-stream. Prepare yourself, men, the only thing we can do is to sail towards the great Amazon river and the Atlantic Ocean..."
67570 "<BLUE> Spanish soldier: The current is too strong! We're being dragged to the shores!"

Do not wait too long to free the Spanish captives since you don't need a lot of troops to rescue them. In addition, the leader of the captives will provide you essential information. Wandering the map before you hear this intel is not advisable.\n\n3. After freeing the captives, start with the quests for the Macapaba and Januacu tribe. Scout the map well and you'll find plenty of rewarding sidequests! These will give you the necessary resources to capture the mines of Los Negros.\n\n4. Francisco de Orellana may reach Imperial Age."
68507 "Your scouts report:\n\nFrancisco de Orellana is travelling towards the ocean. However, he has to retrofit his vessels before he can sail it. Thus he'll need to construct a base.\n\nThe mouth of the Amazon river contains many small islands. The friendly Januacu tribe (cyan) has claimed those in the north, but Los Negros (red and green) have taken over some islands up-river (south). They are your most dangerous enemy on the map. \n\nThe other friendly tribe, Macapaba (yellow), live on the western bank.

68536 "1. Build a town center on the island to secure a base camp."
68537 "<BLUE>Orellana: While we are gathering the necessary resources, we should scout the area. If rumors are true, Los Negros are holding some Spaniards captive."

68539 "<BLUE>Orellana: It's our duty as good Christians! We'll send an expedition to the island east of us. Look for captives. Los Negros are not the only ones who know how to cut some limbs. Use force if you have to."

68546 "<GREY>Juan Cortejo: Time for vengeance!"

68554 "<PURPLE>Fisherman: I'm sorry adventurer, but I'm out of fish. Los Negros have taken my fishing spot! Perhaps you are strong enough to teach them a lesson?"
68555 "- Fisherman: Destroy the fishtraps to scare Los Negros away from the fishing spot."
68556 "<BLUE>Conquistador: I hope they won't balance this food loss with eating more people. Anyway, let's get back to the fisherman and claim our reward."
68557 "<PURPLE>Fisherman: Thanks to you I'm back in business! Take this as a token of my gratitude."
68558 "<PURPLE>Fisherman: I'm off fishing. I just hope the stench of Los Negros didn't scare all the fish away."
68559 "<PURPLE>Master Blacksmith: If you're looking for weapons, you've come at the wrong time. Normally I get my supplies from our mines at the west, but lately I didn't receive any shipment."
68560 "<PURPLE>Master Blacksmith: If you'd check it out I would be most grateful."
68561 "- Blacksmith: Check out the mines to the west of Macapaba."
68562 "<BLUE>Conquistador: Seems like Los Negros have slaughtered these poor miners. We should look inside the cave for survivors."
68563 "<GREEN>Cannibal: Fresh meat has just arrived, boys. Let's get them!"
68564 "- Blacksmith: Check out the mine."
68565 "<BLUE>Conquistador: Just more dead miners inside. We should report this back to the master blacksmith in Macapaba."
68566 "- Return to Master Blacksmith in Macapaba and report your findings."
68567 "<PURPLE>Master Blacksmith: I feared that Los Negros were behind this. But thanks to your actions the mines are safe again and I can restart my business. Please accept this small gift."
68568 "<PURPLE>Master Blacksmith: Apprentice, prepare the workplace! We'll be getting shipments again."
68569 "<PURPLE>High priest: You're just in time to witness the duel between the champion of Macapaba and the champion of Januacu! They'll fight to the death to please the god Huitzilopochtli!"
68570 "<YELLOW>Macapaba priest: If we win this sacred duel, our tribe gains the favor of the gods. Stranger, if you'd guide our champion to victory, we would be forever in your debt."
68571 "- High priest: Guide the champion of Macapaba to victory. Select him to start the duel."
68572 "<YELLOW>Macapaba champion: May the gods give me the strength to beat my opponent!"
68573 "The gods have provided an attack boost!"
68574 "The gods are pleased with the duel and provide an HP buff!"
68575 "The gods sent an attack buff!"
68576 "The gods have provided another HP boost."
68577 "- High priest: Kill the other champion. The gods will provide some buffs so keep your eyes out and get them before your opponent."

68581 "<YELLOW>Priest: You... you've brought eternal shame to our tribe! Curse you, stranger. May Huitzilopochtli take your soul."
68582 "<PURPLE>Researcher: We're currently excavating this ancient temple of Pachacamac, the two-faced god. But at the moment we only found one head."
68583 "<PURPLE>Researcher: We believe the second head to be located on the island nearby, but every expedition we've sent so far hasn't returned. Perhaps you can clear it from any dangers?"
68584 "- Researcher: Clear the island of any danger, so they can start researching the second head of Pachacamac."
68585 "<BLUE>Conquistador: The island is safe. We should return to the researcher."
68586 "<PURPLE>Researcher: Thank you so much for your help! Now we can finally study both sides of Pachacamac."
68587 "<PURPLE>Guard: You'll find nothing of interest behind this gate, stranger. The forest is cursed. Every animal beyond this gate is pure evil."
68588 "<PURPLE>Guard: Last year a strange woman appeared in our town. Soon the animals came... and destroyed our home. I don't know how much longer we can keep them off. Can you help us?"
68589 "- Guard: Find and kill the witch who turned the animals against the villagers."
68590 "<BLUE>Conquistador: The animals seem less vicious. Whatever effect the woman had on them, it's gone. We should report to the guard."
68591 "<GREY>Witch: Haha! Foolish adventurer. Do you wish to oppose the strength of the forest?"
68592 "<PURPLE>Guard: You've killed the wicked witch? Now we can start rebuilding our community! Thank you, mighty stranger."
68593 "<PURPLE>Shaman: So stranger, you've come to test your knowledge? Answer my three riddles correctly and I'll reward you. Answer them incorrectly... and you'll know the meaning of pain."
68594 "<PURPLE>Shaman: If you're up to the challenge, simply eat one of my magic berries."
68595 "- Shaman: Select the forage bush to start the riddles. Select one of the yurts to give your answer."
68596 "<PURPLE>Shaman: Ha, brave lad! Here goes the first one: What always runs but never walks, often murmurs, never talks, has a bed but never sleeps, has a mouth but never eats?"
68597 "<AQUA>CYAN yurt: a cloud"
68598 "<YELLOW>YELLOW yurt: a river"
68599 "<PURPLE>PURPLE yurt: a mountain"
68600 "<PURPLE>Shaman: Haha, not so bright this time! But hold your tears. Eat another berry and try again."
68601 "<PURPLE>Shaman: Oops, wrong guess! If you're still up for it, you can eat another berry and try again."
68602 "<PURPLE>Shaman: Ah the will is strong in this one. Again: What always runs but never walks, often murmurs, never talks, has a bed but never sleeps, has a mouth but never eats?"
68603 "<PURPLE>Shaman: Correct! I knew you were a bright one. If you're up for the second riddle, eat another one of those berries."
68604 "<PURPLE>Shaman: Riddle two it is! I am always hungry, I must always be fed, the finger I touch, will soon turn red. What am I?"
68605 "<PURPLE>PURPLE yurt: fire"
68606 "<YELLOW>YELLOW yurt: earth"
68607 "<AQUA>CYAN yurt: air"
68608 "<PURPLE>PURPLE yurt: darkness"
68609 "<YELLOW>YELLOW yurt: silence"
68610 "<AQUA>CYAN yurt: time"
68611 "<PURPLE>Shaman: I'm sorry, but that's not correct. Eat another berry and try not to disappoint me again."
68612 "<PURPLE>Shaman: Well done! You're one of the few souls who solved all my riddles. I'm impressed."
68613 "<PURPLE>Shaman: My time is done here. The knowledge is passed on. Farewell stranger!"
68614 "<PURPLE>Inspector: You visit us at our darkest hour, stranger. Someone murdered my brother Supay and displayed his body in the middle of our town square!"
68615 "<PURPLE>Inspector: We've arrested four suspects, but we have no further clues. Perhaps you can shed some new light on this gruesome crime?"
68616 "<PURPLE>Inspector: Seek out some villagers and gather what intel you can find. If you've come to a conclusion, return to me and point out the murderer. I would be most grateful!"
68617 "- Inspector: Solve the murder on Supay. Question the villagers on the island (click on purple units)."
68618 "<BLUE>Conquistador: I think I've gathered enough clues. I should return to the town square and bring the murderer to justice."
68619 "<PURPLE>Wife of Supay: I was already at bed when my husband Supay let someone in. It must be a local otherwise he wouldn't have opened the door. Some moments later I heard a terrible scream and ... (indistinct sobbing)"
68620 "<PURPLE>Veteran: I've seen many wounds during my life as a warrior. I tell you this stranger: the one that killed Supay clearly had a military training."
68621 "<PURPLE>Blacksmith: The inspector asked me to take a look at the crime scene as I know a great deal about weapons. I've found nothing but a feather. Perhaps he was tickled to death?"
68622 "<PURPLE>Inspector: Before you voice your conclusions, take a moment to hear the last plea of the suspects. After all, their lives lay in your hands."
68623 "<AQUA>Pacari: I'm Pacari, born and raised on this island. Those who know the jaguar warriors will know they value honor above all else. So I swear on my honor: I did not kill Supay!"
68624 "<YELLOW>Thonapa: I'm Thonapa, warrior from the Macapaba village to the south. I only arrived here after the murder, but the inspector won't believe me."
68625 "<AQUA>Ikhuno: Ikhuno is the name. I live and train at the archery just behind us. Supay was a good neighbor. Why would I want him dead?"
68626 "<AQUA>Apaci the kind: They call me Apaci the kind. I spent my life on this island  reading the signs of the gods. Little do I know about killing."
68627 "<PURPLE>Inspector: You've heard them all. Now, who do you accuse of murdering my brother?"
68628 "<AQUA>Pacari: Wait... What? I've done nothing wrong... Curse you stranger! You sentenced me to death!"
68629 "<YELLOW>Thonapa: Wait... What? I've done nothing wrong... Curse you stranger! You sentenced me to death!"
68630 "<AQUA>Apaci the kind: Wait... What? I've done nothing wrong... Curse you stranger! You sentenced me to death!"
68631 "<AQUA>Ikhuno: How did you...? It doesn't matter, I've no regret. Supay was an annoying man. He stole my arrows. He deserved to die! And so will you!"
68632 "<PURPLE>Inspector: Thank you for finding the murderer of my brother. Please accept this for your trouble."
68633 "<PURPLE>Inspector: I'm not sure we've got the right one, stranger. At least somebody paid for the death of my brother. Please accept this for your troubles."
68634 "<PURPLE>Inspector: With the murder over we can finally bury my brother. And guard, release the other suspects."
68635 "<PURPLE>Trader: You want to make some extra coin? I heard the Macapabas are holding a festival and need lots of food. I can sell it high at their market."
68636 "<PURPLE>Trader: Problem is, the fruit rots. If you can take me there fast enough, I'll split the profit. Just grab some food from our market when you're ready."
68637 "- Trader: You've been asked to escort a trader to Macapaba in time. If you're ready, click on the market next to the trader."
68638 "<PURPLE>Trader: Let's start our journey! Only 4 minutes until the fruit is unsellable."
68639 "<PURPLE>Trader: Just our luck! This gate is locked. We need to get to another one... and fast!"
68640 "<PURPLE>Trader: Only 2 minutes left before the fruit turns bad."
68641 "<PURPLE>Trader: Only 1 minute. Hurry up!"
68642 "<PURPLE>Trader: Only 30 seconds. We need to get these fruits on the market. Now!"
68643 "- Trader: Bring him to the Macapaba market before his fruit has rotten."
68644 "<PURPLE>Trader: Haha! They paid a great price for the fresh fruit. Just as I expected. Here is your share of the profit."
68645 "<PURPLE>Trader: No! The fruit has rotten. We can only sell these as food for livestock. I wouldn't count on a great profit now."
68646 "<PURPLE>Trader: As I expected. They would only accept the fruit for a low price. Here is your part of the profit. Too bad we weren't here before the fruit turned bad."
68647 "<PURPLE>Priest: Los Negros are a brutal people. But now they have gone too far! They started building a temple on the island just south of here."
68648 "<PURPLE>Priest: That island is ours! They have no right! Perhaps if their construction was disrupted by some white outlander, they'll see how foolish their plans are."
68649 "<GREEN>Soldier: Invaders! Kill them. We only need another 40 seconds to complete the temple."
68650 "- Januacu priests: Prevent the construction of the Los Negros temple."
68651 "<BLUE>Conquistador: We've turned the construction site in chaos. This should please the Januacu priests. Let's return and claim our reward."
68652 "<BLUE>Conquistador: We've failed to prevent the construction. We'd better not show our faces to the Januacu priests."
68653 "<PURPLE>Priest: Haha, that will teach them! Good work."
68654 "<BLUE>Conquistador: This place gives me the chills. Perhaps we can find someone in the town of Macapaba who knows more about this place."
68655 "<BLUE>Conquistador: Those cannibals were protecting the ruins of an ancient temple. Perhaps the nearby Macapaba tribe would find this interesting as well."
68656 "<PURPLE>Researcher: We're currently excavating this ancient temple of Pachacamac, the two-faced god. I heard you found the location of a second temple. Thank you so much for the help!"
68657 "<BLUE>Conquistador: Looks like we disrupted the construction of a temple. Some Januacu priests might be interested in this information."
68658 "<PURPLE>Priest: Los Negros tried to build a temple on our island?! And you stopped them? Ha, that will teach them."
68659 "<BLUE>Orellana: Very well. All on board! Let's leave this mad river at once."

69003 "Legions of Rome"
69004 "Goth refugees"
69005 "1. Do not try to enter Rome itself. Only death awaits you there. \n\n2. Many barbarian refugees are still wandering the woods around Rome. Scout well and you might find a friend or two.\n\n3. The trained legionaries possess great fighting abilities. Take them out first and don't let them near your troops.\n\n4. The troops of Rome are powerful thanks to their organization and discipline. However, if you'd cut down the centurions, they'll lose their fighting spirit.\n\n5. Alaric cannot advance to the next age."
69006 "Your scouts report:\n\nAlaric (blue) marches from the east to cut off the supply lines of Rome. He does not have a base camp.\n\nBarbarian refugees (gray) are scattered over the map. They are your allies and are willingly to join. Some refugees (purple) made up a provisionary camp in the south.\n\nYour enemy, Rome (red), is located in the west. However, it's walls are too thick to breach. Worry more about the legions (yellow) they've sent out to counter Alaric's actions."

69010 "Alaric has fallen!"
69013 "<BLUE>GUARD: Scout! Why are you rushing upon our leader in this manner? Speak now before I cut you down where you stand."
69014 "<PURPLE>SCOUT: I'm sorry great Alaric but I have news! Roman transport ships carry large amounts of food into the city by the river. If we are to challenge the Romans, we must stop this now!"
69015 "<BLUE>ALARIC: You're right, we must secure those supply lines! Rome's walls are strong, but they won't help against starvation. We'll take over that river!"
69016 "1. Destroy the three watch towers to take control of the river."
69017 "<BLUE>ALARIC: Great! We've taken control over the river... We should regroup with the other Goths before advancing."
69018 "2. Bring Alaric to the Goth camp in the south."
69019 "<PURPLE>REFUGEE LEADER: Welcome king Alaric. With our combined strength, we can cut Rome's trade routes. Their trading post is just north of here."
69020 "3. Take over and hold the market to the north. This will cut off the final trade route to Rome."
69021 "<BLUE>ALARIC: It is done. Every trader who comes here will be arrested. Now.. We wait for Rome to empty its legionaries upon us."
69022 "<BLUE>We've lost control over the trade route. Our blockade has failed!"
69023 "<PURPLE>Roman scouts! They are upon us!"
69024 "4. Repel the attack of the Roman legions. Do not let them destroy the market."
69025 "<BLUE>SOLDIER: The legion's attack has been repelled! All hail Alaric! All hail Alaric!"
69026 "<BLUE>ALARIC: With their supply lines cut off, the senate will be forced to meet our demands!"
69027 "<PURPLE>SOLDIER: I heard many refugees are still wandering these woods. Last night we saw campfires to the east."
69028 "<BLUE>SCOUT: Alaric, we have found a Goth refugee camp. These fierce soldiers look eager to join our cause."
69029 "<PURPLE>SOLDIER: The gates appear to be locked, but there is another passage to the north, my king."
69030 "<BLUE>SOLDIER: That monastery probably contains valuable treasures! Maybe we can 'convince' these priests to hand them over."
69031 "- Sack the monastery by destroying it."
69032 "- Search the eastern bank of the river for lost refugees. They'll be happy to join your forces."
69033 "<GREY>REFUGEE: You! You're Alaric? I really need your help. I am part of a small group of refugees who has escaped a Roman camp to the north. There are several more of us there. You must help them! Please!"
69034 "- Help the refugee save his fellow soldiers from the Roman's stockade."

69506 "Your scouts report:\n\nAlaric has set up his camp in the center of the map. He's waiting for the emperor's permission for his people to move to their new gained land.\n\nTwo friendly villages (Grey) are located west of Alaric's camp. They lack military strength, but can provide valuable intelligence.\n\nThe right hand of Alaric, Athaulf (green), has set up his camp in the east. He can provide additional troops when needed.\n\nYour enemy, Roman legions (red and yellow), are scattered across the map. "

69513 "<PURPLE>PIKEMAN: My king, my king Alaric! One of our patrols was just slaughtered by Roman legionaries."
69514 "<BLUE>ALARIC: What? Captain, what do you make of this? You said Rome's troops didn't follow us out here."
69515 "<PURPLE>CAPTAIN: My king, the scouts' reports are comprehensive. Those legionaries must have come from somewhere else."
69516 "<BLUE>ALARIC: Strange... Scout! I need you to investigate this. Ride to the nearby villages and find out where these legionaries came from. "
69517 "1. Investigate the village to the north-west"

69522 "<BLUE>SCOUT: My king, it looks like Honorius is sending reinforcements to Rome behind our backs. They have a rally camp just west of us. We've been double-crossed! "
69523 "<PURPLE>ALARIC: What!? The Emperor will pay for his treachery! First, we'll take out that rally camp. Leave none alive."
69524 "<BLUE>SCOUT: Looks like I need to find another way around this."

69526 "1. Destroy the rally camp by razing the main camp tent."
69527 "<BLUE>ALARIC: Kill the rest of the treacherous Romans! Then we go back to the camp."
69528 "<GREEN>SCOUT: My king, I've spotted a large legion moving towards the bridge in the north. We must intercept them before they reach Rome! They'll be here in 10 minutes."
69529 "2. Prepare your army for the incoming legion."
69530 "<BLUE>5 minutes until the Roman army arrives"
69531 "<BLUE>2 minutes until the Roman army arrives."
69532 "<BLUE>The Roman army is nearly upon us!"
69533 "<GREEN>SCOUT: Alaric, Athaulf! We've discovered a second and last rally camp to the north.We couldn't get any closer, because it is heavily fortified."
69534 "3. Kill the Roman General to break the morale of the incoming legion."
69535 "<BLUE>ALARIC: Their General is dead! Give no quarter, kill any remaining soldier."
69536 "<BLUE>ALARIC: Athaulf, send word to the rest of your men. We will need all the men we can muster for this."
69537 "4. Destroy the Roman Fortress"

70003 "Alaric"
70004 "1. Use good tactics and pay heed to the suggestions of your soldiers. Staying on the main road, for example, would be wise.\n\n2. Alaric's captain Athaulf has sent scouts and forces in the way ahead of Alaric. Some wait close by, while others wait in a port town, ready with more ships.\n\n3. Bands of Saurus' men are known to be stationed outside Ravenna. Finding a sea route to the port would help you avoid impossible battles.\n\n4.  Saurus owns many ships around the waters of Ravenna. Staying clear of Ravenna while traveling overseas is a good idea, as you will be less prone to attacks.\n\n5. The Goths are limited to the Castle Age."
70005 "Your scouts report:\n\nAlaric (Cyan) begins with a small force in the west of the map, and plans to meet with the Emperor in Ravenna.\n\nThe city of Ravenna (Purple) lies in the east of the map on the Adriatic coast.\n\nSeveral towns and villages (Red) litter the countryside, and some may be willing to aid you in your mission.\n\nThe forces of Saurus (Green) are your main adversary. Scores of infantry, cavalry, and archers roam the countryside, killing all they find. Saurus himself is known to control a fortress southwest of Ravenna."
70007 "Alaric must survive."
70008 "<RED>Alaric has fallen!"
70009 "<BLUE>BODYGUARD: Alaric, our ally Athaulf has sent men ahead that are surely waiting for us. They will have scouted the area and will have some essential information for you."
70010 "<BLUE>Knight: Ah, Alaric, at last! We've been waiting here for days now. Our mission was from Athaulf- we have scouted ahead for your arrival. In the plains to the east, we encountered a slain merchant and his cart."
70011 "<BLUE>Surely it was but a bandit attack, but if I were you, I would be cautious about entering the woods. Also, men of the Goth, Saurus, have been seen lurking to the south. I wouldn't risk taking that way."
70012 "<BLUE>There is a village up north that some of our men travelled to, but I have heard naught from them since. We should go check if they have any information for us."
70013 "1. Meet up with some of Athaulf's men to the east."
70014 "<BLUE>ALARIC: What in the... bandits? We must not be delayed. Kill them!"
70015 "<GREEN>SAURUS: Forward men! Slay them all!"
70016 "<BLUE>ALARIC: What the...?! We are being attacked! It is my old rival, Saurus!"
70017 "<BLUE>SOLDIER: Alaric! And so we finally meet. We've acquired some ships to make the journey easier for you. We should pass Ravenna and go on to Ravenna's harbor. From there, it's almost a straight walk to the Gates."
70018 "2. Alaric must safely reach the northern village."
70019 "<BLUE>SAILOR: I heard rumours about some restless mercenaries in the port to the east. Perhaps they are willing to join us?"
70020 "<BLUE>MERCENARY: Finally, a worthy commander to join! Let us leave this boring port."
70021 "3. Bring Alaric to Ravenna's Harbor."
70022 "<BLUE>ALARIC: That wasn't the Emperor's harbor. Saurus has taken it over... I will have his head, after I've talked to the Emperor. To Ravenna!"
70023 "4. Bring Alaric to the Emperor's palace in Ravenna."
70024 "<BLUE>ALARIC: Saurus' men have locked the gates to Ravenna! The Emperor has betrayed us. Retreat! Retreat!"
70025 "<BLUE>SOLDIER: My King. We have word of a troubled village to the south. We may shelter our troops there."
70026 "5. Bring Alaric to the Italian village to the south."
70027 "<RED>KNIGHT: You! You are the Goth king who challenged Rome! You, can tame this beast! Saurus and his men are harrasing our village, claiming new people everyday to work at their fortress. Please, kill him for us!"
70028 "6. Destroy Saurus' fortress."
70029 "<BLUE>ALARIC: The fortress of Saurus is destroyed, but the man himself isn't here.. The traitor is a coward!"

70505 "1. Assure that the eastern gate is destroyed, but protect your ram from counterattacks.\n\n2. There are two routes to Athaulf's camp. The southern one through the countryside is far safer, but if you are really daring you can try to race through the camps of the Emperor's legions.\n\n3.

Archers should leave the fighting on the front lines to elephants and fire from a distance instead, while horsemen are good for flanking maneuvers.\n\n2. Make sure to get the experience bonus for your regiment sooner or later, for it will help you to win the first battle.\n\n3. Cutting enemy supply lines will reduce the strength of the defenders of Bathinda.\n\n4. Ghori's headquarters to the far north can prove to be challenging to destroy, but taking it out earlier would be beneficial.\n\n5. Do not rely only on one type of soldiers, because their loyalty could decide the conflict for either side."

Its garrison consists of horse archers, pikemen and skirmishers.\n\nTarain (Cyan) is a small village to the southeast. It won't take sides but can be used for trade by the Chauhans."
72507 "<ORANGE>Prithviraj: I die for the Chauhans!"
72508 "<ORANGE>Soldier: Raja, please choose the troops that you shall command during the battle!"
72509 "Select the Chu Ko Nu to choose the arbalest regiment."
72510 "<ORANGE>Marksman: At your orders, Raja!"
72511 "Select the Paladin to choose the Cavalier regiment."
72512 "<ORANGE>Cavalier: We are the finest Rajput cavalry!"
72513 "Select the Imperial Camel to choose the elephant regiment."
72514 "<ORANGE>Mahout: Elephants are ready to march!"
72515 "<ORANGE>Prithviraj: The battle has started. Full advance! Charge!!!"
72516 "-Bring at least 10 of your units to the enemy hill, marked with a flag."
72517 "<ORANGE>Marksman: The hill is secured. We are more experienced and have become sharpshooters now."
72518 "-Raid the enemy's baggage train and destroy the main yurt."
72519 "<ORANGE>Cavalier: The commander's yurt is in ashes. Our horses are better trained and swifter from now on."
72520 "-Kill 15 enemy units!"
72521 "<ORANGE>Mahout: We inflicted heavy casualties. The elephants can endure more fatigue in future battles."
72522 "1. Rout the Ghorid army."
72523 "<ORANGE>Prithviraj: Ghori is fleeing, we have won the battle!"
72524 "-Destroy the castle in Ghori's camp. It acts as the headquarters and manages the training of the elite troops."
72525 "<ORANGE>Soldier: The enemy castle is no more!"
72526 "-Destroy the mosque in the city, to boost your religious power."
72527 "<ORANGE>Soldier: We have acquired great knowledge from sacred texts in the ruins of the mosque!"
72528 "<ORANGE>Soldier: This wood pile can be used to build siege engines, but first we have to bring our villagers here."
72529 "-Bring 5 villagers to the wood pile east of the fortress."
72530 "<ORANGE>Prithviraj: Fire at will!"
72531 "-Destroy the market in the supply camp northeast of Bathinda."
72532 "<ORANGE>Soldier: We have cut Bathinda's food supply! This will surely weaken its garrison!"
72533 "-Destroy the connecting reservoir of the aqueduct to the west."
72534 "<ORANGE>Soldier: We have cut Bathinda's water supply! Without water, the defenders will be helpless!"
72535 "2. Defeat Muhammad Ghori and capture Bathinda."
72536 "<ORANGE>Prithviraj: The victory is ours! Let us rejoice!"
72537 "<ORANGE>Prithviraj: We are now ready to assault the city. Charge!"
72538 "                                                       --- MAIN OBJECTIVES ---"

72540 "<ORANGE>Soldier: The reinforcements have arrived!"
72541 "<GREEN>Muhammad Ghori: I used the time you spent on attacking that pitiful town to gather many allies under my banners! Run Prithvi, run while you still can!"
72542 "<GREEN>Muhammad Ghori: I learned for your custom to fight only from dawn and until dusk, noble indeed... Launch the night attack!"
72543 "<GREEN>Muhammad Ghori: Today you win, but our day of reckoning will come, Chauhan!"
72544 "<ORANGE>Deserter: We are doomed... Great Sultan, please spare us and we will join you instead!"
72545 "<ORANGE>Soldier: This is the water supply of the city."
72546 "<ORANGE>Soldier: Boulders blocked the river, we can't use our trade carts or receive reinforcements anymore. However, we can use trade cogs."
72547 "<AQUA>Villager: We will give you workers to aid you in your fight!"
72548 "<ORANGE>Soldier: This is the food supply of the city."
72549 "<AQUA>Farmer: For the war effort!"
72550 "<ORANGE>Prithviraj: Now we have to build a strong encampment and take Bathinda!"
72551 "<ORANGE>Soldier: The dishonorable Ghori attacked before sunrise, which is against the code of war, and inflicted heavy casualties on us."
72552 "<ORANGE>Soldier: This must be the seat from which Ghori gives his orders."
72553 "<ORANGE>Soldier: I wonder what treasures this Mosque can provide to us?"
72554 "<ORANGE>Chand Bhai: Ah... my Raj, I'm terribly wounded and I have to retreat to my quarters. You must carry on, without me!"
72555 "<GREEN>Muhammad Ghori: Ah... I die for the glory of the mighty Ghorid Empire!"
72556 "Prithviraj must survive."

73007 "1. The roads in the region around Kurikara are crawling with Taira troops. Taking the most direct route to the city would be advisable.\n\n2. The Taira do not yet know that supplies have been delivered to the city, but they will soon attack ferociously.\n\n3. The sea is of great strategic importance, but the route out of the bay is blocked by dangerous rocks…\n\n4. Having conscripted all locals into the army, the Taira are unable to rebuild any buildings.\n\n5. This battle occurs long before the advent of gunpowder weapons."
73008 "Your scouts report:\n\n-Minamoto no Yoritomo has sent a relief force (Blue) to aid the defenders of the strategic city of Kurikara (Purple), a walled city loyal to Minamoto and under the command of his cousin Yoshinaka.\n\n-The Hojo Clan (Yellow) has a city in the east under the sovereignty of their lord Tokimasa, who has no love for the Taira but will only consider joining the Minamoto if they can break the siege of Kurikara.\n\n-The Taira Army (Orange) will be your primary opponent early on. Their forward siege camp must be destroyed if the siege of Kurikara is to be broken, and three military encampments guard the crossings of the river.\n\n-The Taira Guards (Green) patrol the countryside and their villagers are feeding and supplying the Taira forces.\n\n-Surrounded with a moat and fortified with strong walls, towers, and castles, the Taira capital of Kyoto (Cyan) has yet to be captured by an invading army. Should the walls be breached, legions of soldiers will rush to the defense.\n\n-The Taira armies are commanded by fierce warlords and princes (Red), not the least of them the Emperor Taira no Kiyomori himself. Killing the princes commanding the Taira armies in the field is vital to the success of your armies."

73024 "<PURPLE>YOSHINAKA: Many thanks for the supplies- we are barely holding out. What news from Minamoto?"
73025 "<BLUE>SAMURAI: The cart has been destroyed! How will we supply Yoshinaka now?"
73026 "<BLUE>SAMURAI: Minamoto promises to send help over the mountains, but is currently occupied with a rebellion. We are sent to aid in the defense of the city."
73027 "<PURPLE>YOSHINAKA: Very well- we will do the best we can. Take over defense of the city!"
73028 "<BLUE>SAMURAI: Hurry men, to the defenses! Defend Kurikara with honor!"
73029 "Protect Yoshinaka's palace in Kurikara."

73038 "<BLUE>SAILOR: My lord, we wish to sail around the northern peninsula but are unable to do so due to the treacherous rocks. If we were to capture the lighthouse, then our ships would be able to sail through!"

73102 "Gokturks"
73103 "Hun Raiders"
73104 "Khorasan"
73105 "1. Protect the local villages to ensure a steady flow of tribute.\n\n2. Paying the tributes the White Huns ask of you isn't obligatory, but the White Huns are a dangerous adversary and placating them early on would be wise.\n\n3. Forming an alliance with the Gokturks will help you in defeating the White Huns.\n\n4. If you are low on gold, you can earn a great profit through trade with the trading post at the other end of the Silk Road.\n\n5. Cavalry Archers dominate these plains- countering them with Halberdiers and Elite Skirmishers will be the most cost effective solution. The Persians have excellent cavalry so be sure to use them as well. War Elephants, on the other hand, aren't very useful in this situation.\n\n6. Savarans are Persian heavy cavalry that can regenerate. They come at a price but they are worth their weight in gold."
73106 "Your scouts report:\n\n-In the West, several Persian villages lie spread out over the land. They have little to no fortifications.\n\n-In the North live the tribes of the Gokturks.\n\n-In the East the White Huns have several fortifications in strong positions.\n\n-There is a Fire Temple dedicated to Zoroaster on the edge of the Persian sphere of influence.\n\n-The Silk Road, a trade route stretching from China to the Byzantine Empire, winds through this land and trade is very lucrative here."
73107 "<YELLOW> KHOSRAU: Those treacherous Huns have been squeezing our empire dry for far too long. Our army is on its way but we must keep on paying the Huns until it arrives."
73108 "<ORANGE>GUIDE: Welcome to Khorasan, my lord. Follow me, I'll lead you to a good place to set up camp."
73109 "<ORANGE> GUIDE: This is the spot. Here you can build a small base and collect the resources to pay off the White Huns until you are strong enough."
73110 "<ORANGE> GUIDE: The Persian villages will give you their resources as long as they're protected. Raiders are often sighted in these regions so your help is much needed."
73112 "<YELLOW>KHOSRAU: The White Huns have a battle-hardened army matching our own. Maybe we should contact the Gokturks, a natural enemy of theirs, and attack them from two fronts."
73113 "<AQUA> GOKTURKS: So you want an alliance with us against the White Huns? Very well. Just don't get in our way."
73114 "<YELLOW> COMMANDER: The Persian army has arrived sir..."
73115 "<YELLOW> KHOSRAU: Wait, this is it? Where is the rest of the army?"
73116 "<YELLOW> COMMANDER: Our Western general is still negotiating with the Byzantines about the peace treaty and needs our army in case negotiations fail. However, we do bring you our best cavalry technologies and war elephants."
73117 "<YELLOW> KHOSRAU: It seems that we'll have to do it ourselves then. I will need control over all of our resources to do so."
73118 "<ORANGE> PERSIAN VILLAGES: We're at your command."
73119 "<YELLOW> KHOSRAU: We're ready to bring the fight to the White Huns. Let them know we're done paying tribute."
73120 "<GREEN> How dare you! My army will crush you Persian!"
73121 "<YELLOW> KHOSRAU: The Silk Road going through this region could make us a lot of money. However, the White Huns control the road between India and Persia."
73122 "<YELLOW> KHOSRAU: Great. Now with the Silk Road in our hands we'll earn extra income."
73123 "<AQUA> GOKTURKS: With the White Huns gone, we think we should control the income of the trade in this region. You'd just waste it on your war against the Byzantines anyway."
73124 "<YELLOW> KHOSRAU: The true backbone of the Persian army is its heavy armored cavalry like the Cataphracts and the Savarans. It seems we can recruit some here. (Click on the big pavilion- 1500 gold for 10)"
73125 "<BLUE> TRAINER: Your Savarans are ready, my lord."
73126 "<AQUA>GOKTURKS: These mines on the plateau are ours. Stop mining there or I'll get rid of your miners myself."
73127 "<AQUA> GOKTURKS: That's it. If you want to mine there, you'll have to fight for it."
73128 "<BLUE> MONK: Welcome, my lord. We monks follow the ways of Zoroaster but we're short on men. If you bring us 10 villagers we will give you some of our relics. After all this is the homeland of Zoroaster and there are plenty of relics here. "
73129 "<BLUE> MONK: Thank you, my lord. Let us help you bring the relics to your camp."
73130 "<BLUE> FISHERMAN: To prevent overfishing we breed our own fish. If you send us 1000 wood we would be able to build more traps and release the fish occasionally."
73131 "<BLUE>FISHERMAN: Thank you. You'll now be able to keep a large fishing fleet at all times."
73132 "<AQUA> GOKTURKS: You've defeated us?! Fine, we'll keep our promise and retreat behind the Oxus river."
73133 "<GREEN> WHITE HUNS: How is this possible? You've utterly defeated us... "
73134 "<YELLOW>KHOSRAU: We've defeated our enemies and avenged my grandfather. Long live the Persian Empire!"
73135 "<YELLOW> COMMANDER: Khosrau is dead! We've failed to protect the empire."
73136 "<AQUA>GOKTURKS: So you think you can dishonor our treaty? We'll see about that."
73137 "                                                      ---MAIN OBJECTIVES---"

73145 "- Pay 400 gold in tribute to the White Huns within 5 minutes."
73146 "- Pay 600 gold in tribute to the White Huns within 5 minutes."
73147 "- Pay 1000 gold in tribute to the White Huns within 5 minutes."

73149 "-Destroy and replace the towers guarding the Silk Road."
73150 "-Send 10 villagers to the Fire Temple."
73151 "-Tribute 1000 wood to Khorasan to earn access to their fish supply."
73152 "-You can train ten Savarans by clicking on the main pavilion (costs 1500 gold)."
73153 "<GREEN>WHITE HUNS: We expect you to pay us 400 gold. If you don't you'll face our wrath."
73154 "<GREEN>WHITE HUNS: That will do for now..."
73155 "<GREEN> WHITE HUNS: My spies tell me the great Khosrau himself has arrived to manage his Eastern provinces. I suspect we can expect a bit more this time then. 600 gold."
73156 "<GREEN>WHITE HUNS: I knew you were a man of your word. You'll hear from me again soon."
73157 "<GREEN>WHITE HUNS: I think there's much more gold hidden in your empire somewhere. We now want 1000 gold."
73158 "<GREEN> WHITE HUNS: Our coffers are filled with Persian gold. It's been a pleasure working with you."
73159 "<GREEN> WHITE HUNS: You refuse to pay the tribute? You'll pay dearly for your insolence."

73205 "<AQUA>EAGLE WARRIOR: Warriors from Calakmul have defeated our army. They will soon be on their way to our town. To arms!"
73206 "1. Head to Dos Pilas"
73207 "<AQUA>EAGLE WARRIOR: There are five small raider camps in the area. Destroy them! We need to show them who rules this land."
73208 "2. Advance to the castle age and hold your ground against the attacking Calakmulians in the meantime. You will lose if your town center gets destroyed."
73209 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: We've destroyed the first camp."
73210 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: Another camp is down!"
73211 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: Three camps have been destroyed. Well done!"
73212 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: We took down a fourth camp!"
73213 "-There are five small raider camps around Dos Pilas. Destroying them would help get rid of this nuisance, and there might be a little gold to gain as well."
73214 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: All camps have been destroyed! Ah Chuy Kak will be satisfied."
73215 "<AQUA>SCOUT: We're not strong enough to attack the warriors of Calakmul. Our orders from the masters of Tikal is to stay on the defensive."
73216 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: There is a village situated to the west of us. It is currently occupied by raiders. If we liberate this village, it will certainly give us support in the future."
73217 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: The village has been liberated. Now we'll be able to use its market for trade!"
73218 "-Liberate the village in the west of the map by killing all raiders in that area."
73219 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: Calakmul's attacks aren't letting up. We'll be done for soon!"
73220 "The forces of Calakmul appear to be too strong for us. Will we accept their request and join their side? Or will we remain loyal to Tikal?"
73221 "<PURPLE>CALAKMUL WARRIOR: We hereby claim the city of Dos Pilas for the almighty rulers of our city. You either fight for us, or die!"
73222 "3. You may now choose to remain loyal to Tikal, or surrender to Calakmul and join their side.\n\nSelect the wonder of the city you wish to side with."
73223 "X"
73224 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: Dos Pilas has fallen into the hands of Calakmul! We must flee to Uaxactun and prepare a counterattack."
73225 "4. Flee to Uaxactun in the east."
73226 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: Very well. Let's now prepare a counterattack to recapture Dos Pilas!"
73227 "<BLUE>SPEARMAN: You are welcome to enter Uaxactun, friend of Tikal."
73228 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: Our town hall has been destroyed!"
73229 "-Recapture Dos Pilas by destroying its Town Center."
73230 "<AQUA>SOLDIER: Dos Pilas' Town Center has been destroyed. The city is back in our hands!"
73231 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: Our allies at Naranjo are being attacked by the forces of Calakmul. We must help them!"
73232 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: Naranjo has been captured by Calakmul!"
73233 "-Defend Naranjo for 15 minutes. If the city gets overwhelmed, Naranjo will be captured by Calakmul."
73234 "-Naranjo has defected to the side of Calakmul. Defeat them, we need to show what happens to the ones who join our enemies."
73235 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: Naranjo has been defeated. Well done!"
73236 "<AQUA>SCOUT: We're not strong enough to attack the warriors of Calakmul. Our order from the masters of Tikal is to stay on the defensive."
73237 "5. Defeat Calakmul by destroying its wonder."
73238 "<ORANGE>TIKAL: Calakmul lays in ruins. We are victorious!"
73239 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: Bandits have seized control of a former Tikalian fort on a cliff to the south."
73240 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: The bandit fort has been destroyed!"
73241 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: Reinforcements from Tikal have arrived!"
73242 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: We fight for Calakmul from now on!"
73243 "4. Defeat Tikal by destroying its wonder."
73244 "<PURPLE>CALAKMUL: Tikal is burning. Victory is ours!"
73245 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: There is a Tikalian fort situated on a cliff to the south of Uaxactun. We should destroy it immediately."
73246 "-Destroy the fort of Tikal on the plateau to the south of Uaxactun."
73247 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: The fort has been destroyed!"
73248 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: To the northeast lays the city of Naranjo. Being allies of Tikal, they protect Tikal very well from one side. When we take them down, we could flank Tikal."
73249 "<GREY>SCIENTIST: I've been studying the history of this landscape for over a decade. Because of the ongoing war, it is difficult for me to travel around to look around for artifacts. If you could help me study the area, I'll reward you greatly."
73250 "--1/3 Old Stone Heads examined--"
73251 "--2/3 Old Stone Heads examined--"
73252 "--3/3 Old Stone Heads examined--"
73253 "-Scout the map to find 3 stone heads to examine for the scientist. To examine a head, bring a unit near one. Once you've examined all three heads, return to the scientist."
73254 "<GREY>SCIENTIST: Thank you very much for your research. Here is your reward!"
73255 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: We've spotted a bandit camp to the south. I wonder what they're doing here..."
73256 "-Destroy the bandit camp to the south and find out why they're here."
73257 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: The bandits were protecting a large gold mine. Look at all of this!"
73258 "<GREY>MONK: Our fellowship of monks have been searching for a holy relic for decades. We will reward you greatly if you find this relic. "
73259 "-Find the relic the monks have spoken about and bring it into their monastery."
73260 "<GREY>MONK: I can hardly believe my eyes. You found the relic! You will be greatly rewarded."
73261 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: We had better bring this relic to the monastery of those monks. We could get cursed if we keep it for ourselves!"
73262 "<AQUA>WARRIOR: I believe this is the relic those monks spoke of- let's bring it to their monastery."
73263 "<GREY>MAN: I trade in turkeys. Bring every turkey you find to my workshop. I will reward you greatly."
73264 "-Are you in need of gold and have spare turkeys? Bring them to the workshop of the turkey trading man. He will pay you 100 gold for each turkey you give to him."

73275 "1. Be on your guard while scouting. The area around Dos Pilas is crawling with bandits. They will pick off any unwanted traveller they see.\n\n2. Don't spend too much time constructing a base when you might have to flee from there at some point.\n\n3. There is not many gold available. If there only was a market in the area we could use for trade.\n\n4. You are limited to but one town center.\n\n5. Scouting around and clicking on grey units will enable various side quests, completing these will grant you significant bonuses.\n\n6. There are several artifacts scattered around the countryside. A relic is rumored to lie in an overgrown jungle in a ravine southwest of Tikal. Stone carvings lie on the road northwest of Dos Pilas, on a bank across the stream from an abandoned tower southeast of Dos Pilas, and in the mountains east of Uaxactun, respectively.\n\n7. You are able to advance to the imperial age, but bear in mind that the Mayans did not have access to advanced siege engines like trebuchets, or gunpowder units like petards."
73276 "Your scouts report:\n\nYou have a handful of units under your control at the start. Together with troops of Dos Pilas, you’re defending a ford against the forces of Calakmul.\n\nDos Pilas (yellow) is a small city currently under control of Tikal. They’ll be training a mixed army.\n\nTikal (orange) is a huge city located in the east of the map. They will train a host of different units to fight their enemies. Their unique unit, the slinger, will tear apart any infantry which comes near it.\n\nCalakmul (purple) is another colossal city, located in the north of the map. Just as Tikal, their military will be diverse. Their unique unit, the jaguar warrior, will be a pain to fight against in hand to hand combat. Taking them out from a distance, before they reach your troops, would be a sound plan.\n\nUaxactun (blue) is another small city siding with Tikal. They will be training a small, but varied army to fight their opponents.\n\nNaranjo (red) is probably the smallest city in the area. Their military consists of eagle warriors, plumed archers, scorpions and swordsmen. Naranjo is not an aggressive city; their behaviour will be focused on the defences.\n\nRaiders (green) are a pain for everyone. They roam the countryside around Dos Pilas and harass unsuspecting victims.\n\nCountryside (grey) simulate the neutral people who do not side with any of the mentioned cities. They generally have to do with the numerous side quests to be found when scouting the map."

Avoid the Pechenegs as much as you can.\n\n2. The Pechenegs may defeat you several times. Keep moving on and do not give up- in the end you will find a safe home for your people.\n\n3. If you have to cross a river to attack an enemy, it is a good idea to build a military base on their land, so you can reinforce your army more easily.\n\n4.This is a long scenario- save often."
73308 "Your scouts report:\n\nThe Magyars (Red) start in the eastern part of the map with a yurt village, a few troops, hunting wolves and livestock. You are surrounded by Pecheneg warriors. Do not fight them, for you are hopelessly outnumbered. Try to minimize your losses and save as many units and animals as you can.\n\nPechenegs (Yellow) reside in the northern part of the map and are the mortal enemy of the Magyars. Their army is very strong, avoid them as much as you can.\n\nThe powerful empire of the Khazars (Orange) lies to the south. They are allied to the Magyars, and enemies of the Pechenegs. It might be a good idea to contact them.\n\nThe Kabars (Cyan) are people living under the authority of the Khazar empire. They are friendly towards the Magyars.\n\nThe Byzantines (Blue) are a strong empire far to the southwest. They are friendly towards the Magyars.\n\nThe Bulgars (Purple) live far to the west. Not much is known about them, except that they often have border conflicts with the Byzantines. They seem to be skilled warriors.\n\nThe Moravians (Green) live far to the west, north of the Bulgars."

73333 "<ORANGE>KHAGAN: Welcome, Magyars! The Pechenegs are our enemies as well. You can live on the periphery of my empire as long as you pay taxes regularly. In turn we will share our technology and cultivation methods with you. You can also trade with us."

The most effective way of searching an area is spreading your units all over it.\n\n4. When preparing the army in Messina, you can use a Market to trade the available resources according to your needs.\n\n5. When you have occupied Limassol, you can find resources outside of the city walls. Build Town Centers to secure them and protect your Villagers.\n\n6.Everybody is allied to you at the start, but the peace is fragile. Be careful, for there is tension in the air."

You start your journey north of Sicily on board of your ships.\n\n-Tancred (Green), king of Sicily, resides in his city (Palermo) in the western corner of the map. He is your ally and will host the meeting of kings.\n\n-Philip Augustus (Blue), king of France is an old rival of Richard, but this time they will join their forces for a common goal. His camp is already in Sicily next to Messina. Philip is not known for his prowess on the battlefield, but for plotting and conniving instead.\n\n-Messina (Yellow) is a city on the eastern coast of Sicily. It is protected by walls and has a well-equipped port. They are your allies, but do not abuse their patience.\n\n-Limassol (Cyan) is a port city on Cyprus. Cyprus is in the north eastern part of the map.\n\n-Isaac Komnenos (Cyan) is the ruler of Cyprus. Usually he resides in Nicosia, a well fortified city in the middle of Cyprus. He is your ally, but he is not very fond of the Western European royal dynasties.\n\n-Cyprus (Cyan) represents the inhabitants of Cyprus, both civilian and military.

73542 "<GREEN>TANCRED: All right, Richard. I do not want more bloodshed. Here is the inheritance of your sister. Let us sheathe the sword. I also give you ships to support you on the Crusade."
73543 "<RED>RICHARD: Thank you, Tancred. I knew that I would be able to convince you. Now it is time to prepare for the crusade! Men, we are done here. All aboard!"

73545 "<RED>RICHARD: This is going to be your ship, my sister. I hope, you will find it comfortable."
73546 "6. Board the units you want to take on the Crusade onto the 5 Transport Ships. You can bring up to 50 units (heroes included). Keep in mind that you are going to besiege fortified cities. Click the castle of Tancred (Green, in the West of the map) if you are ready to launch the fleet."

73667 "1. Be wary that not all of the Beys will decide to join the Rum Sultanate, they may support the nomads instead, thus you'll have to kill them to ensure the loyalty of their troops.\n\n2. Choose your bride from the strongest turkish state, because you'll have to conquer the rest after that.\n\n3. You can't recruit any gunpowder units, except janissaries."

Controlling the rich land of southern England, the kings of Wessex have inherited all that the Romans once left behind.\n\n-The Scottish lords controlling the Strath of the River Clyde are rulers of fearless warriors who are the core of a burgeoning kingdom.\n\n-The Irish dynasty of Ui Neill controls most of Northern Ireland, but has been greatly weakened by dynastic struggle and wars with its more powerful southern neighbor.\n\n-The Irish kingdom of Munster, with its seat at the famed Rock of Cashel, has been waging war quite effectively against its neighbors.\n\n-Viking longboats, the most powerful warship of the age, will make quick work of any opposition."

73723 "<RED>CAPTAIN: My lord, we have scouted the British Isles and found several suitable sites for a camp! We should be sure to avoid the local settlements though- their defenders are far too powerful for us to fight at the moment."
73724 "<RED>JARL: Let us make haste and set up a camp!"
73725 "1. Construct a camp- build a Town Center, a Barracks, a Market, and 5 houses at any one of the 5 campsites (marked on the map by flags)."
73726 "<RED>JARL: Excellent! Our camp is complete. We should build up a force and await the arrival of the main army from overseas."

73732 "1. To take vengeance on King Aella and prove the superiority of the Norse Gods, destroy the palace in the Northumbrian city of York and replace it with a temple to Odin (wonder) of your own."
73733 "2. Capture 15 relics and place them in your monasteries."

To represent this, many different types of soldiers with their names changed can be found in this scenario.\n\n2. You control a small amount of troops for most of the scenario and will only periodically receive reinforcements, so be frugal and use good tactics.\n\n3. The powder cart will sometimes be allowed past the bridge without incident, but if it is stopped by the gun-toting guards, then it will have to be manually tasked onwards.\n\n4. The order in which you choose to help the rebel Voivods can make a great difference in your success, though reaching Istvan is impossible until you have helped Jakub and Danislav.\n\n5. When the Hungarian army arrives, concentrate on clearing out the troops blocking the small pass to the harbor, and RUN! Your army is expendable, but Dracula and the 3 other Voivods must reach the transport ship."
76045 "Your scouts report:\n\nDracula begins the game just outside the allied Turkish capital of Edirne (Adrianople). He must cross the Danube River to enter his homeland of Wallachia.\n\nThe usurper Vladislav II of the Danesti clan, Voivod (prince)  of Wallachia, holds a firm grip over most of Wallachia, with a strong army spread throughout the diverse region. He is by far the most dangerous enemy.\n\nThere are currently three self-proclaimed Voivods (princes) in rebellion against Vladislav II that could be useful allies:\n\n-Jakub (Blue) is the strongest, and his castle stands in the center of the map, guarding the main crossing of one of the Danube tributaries.\n\n-Danislav (Orange) just lost his capital to Vladislav II, and as a result is hiding in the woods in the west of the map with a few loyal men.\n\n-Istvan (Yellow) is pinned down in his castle in the north of the map by a massive Danesti siege army.\n\nSeveral Wallachian (Grey) villages litter the map, though many are in the hands of Vladislav II. n\nThe army of Hungary (Green) has not been seen in Wallachia for a month, but they support Vladislav II, and their fearsome cavalry are renowned throughout Europe."

76062 "<RED>DRACULA: I wish to retake my father's kingdom."

76088 "<RED>DRACULA: I'll do my best."

76100 "Observe the battlefield. When you are done, select Dracula."
76101 "<RED>DRACULA: They have cannons, Hungarian Huszars, and Hungarian Swordsmen. How?"
76102 "Select Istvan to continue."
76103 "<YELLOW>ISTVAN: I do not know, but that is unimportant at the present. Their cavalry are aligned in front, which means we will likely see a charge. Dracula, lead us to victory!"
76104 "<RED>DRACULA: Vladislav II will drown in his own blood."

76112 "<AQUA>VLADISLAV II: Charge!"

76525 "<GREY>HERMIT: Halt, friends! A large Danesti force blocks the mountain pass!"
76526 "<GREY>HERMIT: If you were to slay the Danesti general in command of their forward camp, it may draw the attention of the army and lure them away!"
76527 "-Kill the Danesti general (cavalier) in command of the forward camp. It is rumored he likes walking the well-trod road northeast of the camp..."

The road between the cliffs directly northwest of Moldavia is the best way to reach the Bran castle, and it is also the route that the Danesti general likes to take on his leisurely walk.\n\n2. Hungary will offer its alliance if you can prove your mettle by reaching the Imperial Age, so assure that they are not destroyed.\n\n3. Once you reach the Bran Castle, the scenario will begin to play like a game of 'Risk'. Most local (Grey) towns, cities, and villages on the map can be captured by each major power, and each has certain useful buildings from which to train troops. Control of a town is determined by ownership of the converting torches in each one. Guard them carefully, or they will quickly fall! The main city of each player, however, cannot be captured and must be destroyed the old-fashioned way.\n\n4. Some buildings have special mechanics to make up for being unable to train units from them. The Bran Castle (wonder) will periodically produce Paladins for Dracula, and the port inn (trade workshop) in the center of the map will recruit mercenaries.\n\n5. Vlad Dracula may reach the Imperial Age."
76547 "Your scouts report:\n\nDracula and his loyal lords begin in exile in the Kingdom of Moldavia (Orange), which will field an army of Boyars, archers, infantry, and siege with some cavalry thrown in. Moldavia supports Dracula's claim to the Wallachian throne.\n\nSeveral local towns and cities (Grey), many of them on the Danube River,  are scattered across the map. In the far North lies the Bran Castle, the headquarters of the crusading Order of the Dragon, who are loyal to the Draculesti clan (Dracula's family).\n\nIn the northwest of the map lies a Hungarian (Green)  military base. Hungary trains droves of cavalry supported by some light infantry, archers, and siege. Their allegiance is unknown- they previously backed Vladislav II, but they have been angered by his pro-Turkish policies and so might support Dracula instead.\n\nIn the south lies the territory of the Ottoman Empire (Purple), which is now hostile towards Dracula due to their newfound support of Vladislav II, but are far more focused on fighting the Hungarians. Their army is comprised of light infantry, cavalry, archers, siege, and the legendary Janissaries.\n\nVladislav II (Cyan) is by far the greatest threat, controlling the Wallachian capital of Targoviste in the far west of the map. He will train heavy cavalry, infantry, archers, siege, monks, and the fearsome Boyars. In addition, he may try to control the Danube River with a flood of ships."

Janissaries guard the castle well. You could try to distract them, but be warned, it won't take long before they will discover what's going on so you have to garrison your troops in the castle once they're gone.\n\n4. Four of the villages are feeding the Turkish fortress of Darstor. Destroying these villages will cripple Darstor's capacity to fight.\n\n5.

Their fortifications and strong army will provide strong resistance, though they rely on the neighboring villages for supplies...\n\nFour villages are supplying the fortress of Darstor but are only themselves defended by a token force:\n\n-Obluciza (Green) is located in the northeast of the map on your side of the river, and supplies Darstor with stone.\n\n-Orsova (Yellow) is located in the southwest of the map on your side of the river, and supplies Darstor with wood.\n\n-Novoselo (Orange) is located in the east of the map, across the river, and supplies Darstor with food.\n\n-Rahova (Cyan) is located in the south of the map, across the river, and supplies Darstor with gold."

77507 "NOTE: Some parts of the map are inaccessible at certain points of the scenario, or for its entirety. Objectives will only pertain to the areas that are accessible at the time.\n\n1. The first part of the scenario is a cutscene depicting Dracula's response to the first wave of Ottoman invaders. All you need to do is sit back, watch, and enjoy.\n\n2. Each fortress has several strengths and weaknesses and can train different troops, so use fitting strategies for their defense, and beware of enemy siege weapons!\n\n3. Dracula's 'scorched earth' campaign requires that the countryside is completely obliterated (destroy all buildings except houses unless otherwise prompted) and the Ottoman Forward Troops defeated.\n\n4. The Night Attack on the Ottoman camp is a valiant but doomed effort. Once most of your army is lost you will receive further objectives.\n\n5. Vlad Dracula and his kingdom of Wallachia may reach the Imperial Age."
77508 "Your scouts report:\n\nDracula begins the scenario in his capital of Targoviste, but plans to lead his vast army of 22,000 (Grey) to the Danube River to ambush a contingent of the Ottoman army.\n\nThe Ottomans (Purple) are the most dangerous adversary. Their advance into Wallachia is spearheaded by an army of Janissaries, archers, heavy cavalry, siege, and polearms, and they will set up forward camps as they advance.\n\nDracula's kingdom of Wallachia (Grey) controls most of the small towns and fortresses on the map, which must be held at all costs.\n\nThe Ottoman Forward Troops (Purple) are a nominal threat, and have some units scattered around the map which will have to be dealt with sooner or later.\n\nThe countryside (Yellow) is next to no threat, as only a token force guards their buildings. If captured by the Turks, however, they could supply the vast Ottoman army.\n\nIn the far north of the map is Poenari, Dracula's personal castle. This is the best place to make a last stand, and its convenient location allows for an escape to Hungary in desperate circumstances."
77525 "Wallachia, Spring of 1462                                                                                                                                                                                                     Central town square of Targoviste"

77527 "<RED>DRACULA: It must be the vanguard for a greater force. Quickly, messenger! Send word to my vassals to mobilize at great haste!"

77537 "<RED>DRACULA: Kill them! Kill them all!"
77538 "<RED>DRACULA: Finish them off! We will impale them all back at Targoviste!"
77539 "A great victory was won that day, and true to his word, Dracula impaled all of the Turks outside Targoviste."
77540 "However, Ottoman troops crossed the Danube again and threatened two of Dracula's border castles."
77541 "Defense of these castles was vital, for they were gateways into Vlad's kingdom."
77542 "<GREY>ISTVAN: We must defend these castles against the invading army of the Turks!"
77543 "1. Drive back the attacking Turks by killing 500 of their troops."

77554 "2. Raid the countryside and pillage and burn everything! In addition, clear out all Ottoman troops you find."
77555 "<RED>DRACULA: That's enough for now, men. Let us return to Targoviste!"
77556 "<RED>DRACULA: The gold from these mines will pay for plenty of mercenaries!"
77557 "<RED>DRACULA: The mines here are overflowing with wealth! Let us loot what we can!"
77558 "<RED>DRACULA: Mills like these hold much food! Let us destroy it and all others like it!"
77559 "<RED>DRACULA: Throw their corpses down the well. Let's see the Turks drink fouled water!"

77569 "<RED>DRACULA: I cannot die here! There is still so much to do!"
77570 "<RED>DRACULA: A treacherous Boyar in the Turkish army? Impale him!"
77571 "Once the Turkish army approached Targoviste, the Sultan was horrified at the sight of his impaled men, and fled back to his capital."
77572 "Commanding the Turkish army in the Sultan's place was a familiar face: Radu, Dracula's own brother, now a puppet of the Sultan."
77573 "The Turkish army was far better-equipped and Dracula had lost many of his men in the prior battles. Dracula was forced to flee north, to Poenari Castle."
77574 "<RED>DRACULA: It would appear that we have visitors..."
77575 "<GREY>MONK: My lord, we come to provide you with holy consort."
77576 "<RED>DRACULA: Ah, monks! Tell me, what does God think of these impaled men?"
77577 "<GREY>FIRST MONK: You are the ruler of this land and God respects your judgment."
77578 "<GREY>SECOND MONK: Dracula, God finds you a despicable being, but your defense of this land is admirable in His eyes."
77579 "<RED>DRACULA: I appreciate honesty, but I detest patronizing liars. Impale the one who spoke first!"
77580 "<PURPLE>ARTILLERY OFFICER: Load, aim, fire!"
77581 "<RED>DRACULA: The Turks are attacking! Defend Poenari at all costs!"
77582 "3. Survive the onslaught for 15 minutes."
77583 "<RED>DRACULA: We have survived thus far, but we are nearly broken! However, I have one more trick up my sleeve..."
77584 "The Poenari Castle must not fall."
77585 "The Poenari castle was destroyed!"
77586 "4. Take the mountain path to the southeast to rendezvous with the Wallachian army."
77587 "<RED>DRACULA: Well met, friends! Now to destroy the Turk camp!"
77588 "<RED>DRACULA: The Sultan is not here and we have no hope to hold back the Turks! I must flee to Hungary!"
77589 "6. Dracula must flee to Hungary! The sewers of the Poenari Castle empty out in a mountain stream, where Dracula has a small boat just for this purpose. Garrison Dracula in the castle to take this route."
77590 "<RED>DRACULA: Off to Hungary! I will be back!!!"

80007 "1. The military strength of the Turkish Raiders is in their many camps. Their production will decrease with each one you raze.\n\n2. Dracula's capture of the fortress of Sabac will give Hungary a much larger and stronger base to aid you from.\n\n3. Controlling the Danube River will prove beneficial not only for its large population of fish but also for the ability to launch naval attacks on the enemy. At the very least, guard the many bridges, fords, and other crossings.\n\n4. To destroy the cities of both Basarab and the Turks, you will need heavy siege equipment and well-equipped troops. Initially you will have neither, but with the help of some of the locals you might overcome this disadvantage...\n\n5. Vlad Dracula is limited to the Castle Age."
80008 "Your scouts report:\n\nDracula begins the scenario in a Hungarian camp on the Danube River, which he must defend from early Ottoman attacks.\n\nThe Ottoman Raiders (Purple) pose a threat early on, mounting attacks from several camps on the southern side of the Danube. They will train archers, knights, spearmen, and siege in their attempts to destroy your camp.\n\nHungary (Green) is your strongest ally, and will support you with armies with a core of heavy cavalry and siege if you can hold off the Turks and establish a foothold in Wallachia.\n\nGuarded by a token force, the Turkish fortress of Sabac (Purple) lies on the Danube and is coveted by Hungary.\n\nWallachia (Grey) is tired of a decade of oppression under the Turkish yoke and is eager to help Dracula reclaim the throne.\n\nThe usurper and Turkish puppet Basarab Laiota (Cyan) controls the main Wallachian cities and fortresses northwest of Targoviste, but has little support from the populace and therefore can only field a weak army. The core of his army is the many Boyars who supported his rise to power.\n\nThe greatest threat by far is from the Ottoman Army (Purple), firmly entrenched in Targoviste. Their army is mobilized in its full might and prepared for all-out war, boosting droves of Janissaries, Sipahis, siege, and Muslim priests in addition to the standard levy of infantry and archers.\n\nItalian mercenaries (Yellow) are rumored to have set up a camp in Wallachia. Perhaps they will help you..."

80029 "<ORANGE>CRAFTSMAN: There is something I would wish to discuss with the great Vlad Dracula. Perhaps, he would honor me by visiting me here at my shop?"
80030 "<RED>DRACULA: Well met, friend. You requested to see me?"
80031 "<ORANGE>CRAFTSMAN: So the rumors are true--my lord has returned!"

Needless to say, they should form the core of your fighting force.\n\n2. The city of Cordoba and the Visigoth fortresses are well-fortified. You will require well-supported siege equipment to breach them.\n\n3. Fish are abundant in the Atlantic Ocean and the Alboran Sea as well as several rivers, but beware of marauding Visigoth ships.\n\n4. If you run low on gold, you can trade across the sea with the Berber city of Ceuta to the south. Pirate hoards are also rumored to be located on various islands and might provide a decent boost to your economy.\n\n5. The Berber army is restricted to the Castle Age and its population limit is 120. Reinforcements of heavy troops, however, will periodically arrive from North Africa."
81006 "Your scouts report:\n\n- Tariq Ibn Ziyad's army (Yellow) has landed at Gibraltar and must defeat the army of the Visigoth king Roderic (Green) in order to establish a foothold in the region before the Berbers deem it safe to send him villagers to establish a camp.\n\n- The army of the Visigoth king Roderic (Green) has assembled on the far side of the ford in the northwest and is comprised mainly of infantry units with a few supporting archery and cavalry units. It is loosely unified, however, and will be demoralized beyond help should their leader fall in battle.\n\n- A pair of Visigoth fortresses (Cyan) in the northeast watch over much of the region, and their troops will aggressively resist any invader. The core of their armies is infantry, but they will employ small contingents of archers, cavalry, and siege as well, and send warships to attack from the water.\n\n- The city of Cordoba (Purple, located in the far north of the map) is well-fortified and its strategic location means that it will have to be taken if the Berber army is to control southern Iberia. Legions of archers, cavalry, infantry, siege, and clerics will provide staunch resistance on the land, while their warships will defend the city from amphibious incursions.\n\n- There are a couple local villages (Grey) spread across the region that may be willing to aid your war effort once Roderic's army is defeated.\n\n"

Toledo must be captured quickly in order to establish a foothold in the region and resupply the troops.\n\n- The Visigoth garrison of Toledo (Green) represents only a token defense of the city, and is comprised of infantry, archers, and a few scorpions. They have also erected several makeshift towers guarding the main gates and the bridge across the river Tagus.\n\n- The city of Cordoba and several local settlements (Orange) are situated in the east of the map. They will serve as valuable trade partners should your gold supply run low.\n\n\nFour of the surrounding fortified towns pose significant threats:\n\n- Seville (Blue) lies far to the south, and will field armies of Crossbowmen, Light Cavalry, Pikemen, and a few siege units.\n\n- Merida (Red) is situated in the southwest, and its formidable fortress complex is guarded primarily by Huskarls, Pikemen, Long Swordsmen, and Cavalry Archers.\n\n- Talavera (Purple) controls the far west of the map, and trains Knights, Light Cavalry, Skirmishers, siege units, and will also build ships to harass you from the river.\n\n- Guadalajara (Cyan) lies far to the north.

81405 "1. Your bases are divided and cannot be connected until the two southernmost Asturian fortresses are destroyed. Difficult as it might be, preserving both bases is vital due to their economic and strategic value.\n\n2. You can ignore the Kingdom of Asturias if you like, but its control of strategic locations and constant raids on your flank might make them a necessary target. Each Asturian fortress is also home to a precious holy relic - capturing them can greatly boost your gold income.\n\n3. As well as being a potential trade partner, Theodemir of Murcia has pledged to occasionally provide your armies with tribute and military support.\n\n4. The Mediterranean Sea is an abundant source of fish. Additionally, a trade route to the Balearic Islands will be quite lucrative, provided you can defend it from enemy vessels.\n\n5. This battle takes place centuries before the introduction of gunpowder into Europe."
81406 "Your scouts report:\n\n- The Umayyad-Berber army (Yellow) advances in a two-pronged assault on northeastern Iberia. One camp, situated in the south of the map, is poised to strike at the Visigothic cities of Zaragoza (Green) and Narbonne (Cyan), while the second camp, located in the far west of the map, lies on the border of the Kingdom of Asturias (Red).\n\n- To the far south lies the Visigothic realm of Murcia (Orange), an ally and dependency of the Umayyad Caliphate.\n\n- The city of Zaragoza (Green) guards the easternmost crossing of the Ebro river. Zaragoza will field an army of cavalry, Pikemen, and Skirmishers, and a small navy safeguards the city from seaborne incursions up the Ebro river.\n\n- The city of Narbonne (Cyan) lies in the far northeast of the map on the Mediterranean coastline. Their army consists of Skirmishers and auxiliary Light Cavalry built around a core of infantry. Their navy prowls the Mediterranean, eager to harass any attempts at fishing and trade.\n\n- The Kingdom of Asturias (Red) is by far the greatest threat. Multiple fortresses in defensible, strategic locations sprawl over the western half of the map, and their army of heavy infantry, cavalry, and powerful siege engines will present a serious challenge to your forces.\n\n- The locals (Grey) on the Balearic Islands in the east of the map are willing trade partners and may be willing to allow you to use their mines."

The enemy fortresses nestled in the mountains are nigh impregnable. If you encounter one, turning around and finding another route is the best course of action.\n\n3. You have no way of researching upgrades, but local villages may be impressed by your army and supply you with the upgrades you need.\n\n4. Protect your ranged units - their tactical value increases exponentially in this land of cliff paths and narrow passes.\n\n5. Throughout most of the map, the high walls of the mountains will protect your troops from the worst of the elements. Cliffed passes, however, are treacherous and exposed to the harsh winds. Units lingering in them for too long will begin to suffer damage due to exposure to the cold."
81606 "Your scouts report:\n\n- The army of Abd ar-Rahman al-Ghafiqi (Yellow) has assembled near a local village just south of the Pyrenees mountains. Their objective is to cross the treacherous region and rendezvous with the Umayyad soldiers (Orange) who have made camp north of the mountain range.\n\n- A few local villages (Grey) dot the map, overlooking important junctions and mountain passes. Their location makes them apt resting places but seemingly little more.\n\n\nThree enemies pose a significant threat to the Umayyad army as it crosses the Pyrenees:\n\n- The Asturians (Red) are only a faint presence in this region, but their fortified bastion in the center of the map and well trained, heavily armored troops nevertheless pose a threat worth considering.\n\n- The Visigoths (Purple) prowl the eastern Pyrenees and are based in a fortress overlooking one of the major eastern passes. Their balanced army of infantry, ranged units, and light cavalry will provide stout opposition to any who would pass their way.\n\n- The Basques (Green) are native to the western Pyrenees. Their army of light infantry, javelineers, and light cavalry would normally only pose a token threat, but their adept strategic use of the terrain makes them deadly to even a better-equipped force."

These armies are too strong to fight and should be avoided at all costs - use the line of sight of your light cavalry to warn you of their arrival.\n\n2. There are three suitable locations for you to establish your camp - one in the far south of the map, one in the east of the map, or you can choose to expand the camp you begin the scenario with. Each choice has different benefits and drawbacks.\n\n3. Fishing is plentiful in the Bay of Biscay, though your enemies will do their best to harass your fleet.\n\n4. The city of Bordeaux and the fortresses of the Frankish army are well fortified - you will require advanced siege equipment to breach them.\n\n5. Several relics lie scattered around the map - some within the walls of Frankish fortresses, and some nestled in the countryside."
81804 "Your scouts report:\n\n- The army of Abd ar-Rahman al-Ghafiqi (Yellow) has made camp in the south of Aquitania and has been conducting raids while awaiting reinforcements. Its sights are set in particular on the Frankish city of Bordeaux.\n\n- Three Aquitanian villages (Purple) lie in close proximity to the Berber camp. They are providing the Franks with supplies but are only defended by a token force and should crumble easily to a swift raid.\n\n- The city of Bordeaux (Blue) lies near the mouth of the Garonne river, boasting excellent fortifications and a strong land army of mixed composition. Their navy prowls the Bay of Biscay, picking off enemy ships at will.\n\n- The Frankish army (Red) is by far your most dangerous opponent. Numerous fortresses sprawl across the countryside, and hordes of battle-hardened Paladins, Throwing Axemen, swordsmen, and auxiliary troops will be a true test for the proud Berber cavalry."

82209 "Your scouts report:\nFrancisco de Almeida commands Fort Graciosa on an island in the Loukkos River. The island has limited resources, however, and must rely on Berber villages on either side of the river.\n\nThe local Emir (Red, Saracens) rules the city of El Araich guarding the river's estuary west of Fort Graciosa. He fields swordsmen, skirmishers, and knights, as well as a strong navy. The threat of Portuguese cannons has kept him friendly to Portugal's interests. Until we gain the upperhand over the Barbary Pirates, he may be a worthwhile ally... for a heathen.\n\nThe Barbary Pirates (Green, Berber) occupy a former caravanserai and harbor on the north bank of the river. As long as their fleets remain strong and able to seize Christian and Muslim cargoes alike, they will be a difficult adversary. As well as being sailors, the corsairs are skilled archers and spearmen.\n\nThe Banu Arous (Yellow, Berber) are light cavalry and camel raiders from the deserts to the south and east. They are an ancient people who still prize tattooed women as their Numidian ancestors did in the time of Hannibal, despite the rigid influence of seven centuries of Islamic law. Venturing into the desert and destroying their tents is the only way to end their raids.\n\nOff the Mauretanian coast are the Canary Islands, territory of the Kingdom of Castile. European treaties matter little in this dangerous frontier, however, and the islands would be a rich source of resources, provided the native Guanches (Purple, Malians) can be pacified. Pagan cousins to the Berbers, they mummify their dead as they have done for centuries. Covered in goatskins with necklaces of bone and shells, they are skilled skirmishers and boatmen.\n\nThe flagship of the Ottoman privateer Kemal Reis (Gray, Turks) has been sighted off the coast, attacking Christian ships in support of the beleaguered Emir of Granada. Defeating him in battle would be a boon to the war against the Moors and Ottomans.\n\nAnd somewhere off the African coast, an expedition led by Duarte Pacheco Pereira has been rumored lost."

His fleet is based on the northern side of the Gulf of Khambhat, north of Diu. The Mamluk army consists of mamelukes, cavalry archers, and siege supported by a detachment of Venetian condottieri. The Venetians also provide the funding for the Mamluk expedition through the resources gathered by their trade embassies (feitorias).

The rebellion in the neighbouring Nubian kingdom of Alodia is spilling into this region. Whatever side we choose, their help can come in handy.\n\n3. Try not to waste any time. Dagnajan's army will be here soon and the more you do early on the easier it will be to stop his mighty army."
84407 "Your scouts report:\n\nOur men and villagers will arrive in the north, in a more arid area of the region. It won't be easy to get sufficient supplies here so we'll have to use every resource available to us in order to succeed.\n\nThe Begemder kingdom (Cyan) is to the east in one of the green valleys and is allied to our enemy. They'll try to delay us while Dagnajan builds up his army. It would be wise to raid them. Their army consists of swordsmen, crossbowmen, and camels.\n\nJust south of us, we have found that Darginda (Orange) has fortified the pass leading to their kingdom. Helping them to secure the pass when the enemy army is on the move should be a priority.\n\nThe kingdom of Alodian is having trouble with rebellions. The kingdom has no relations with us but it would be wise for us to either support the kingdom or their rebels to further our interests in the region. Alodian traders (Yellow) have set up a trade post to the west, and a bit further north, the Alodian rebels (Purple) have set up their camp.\n\nDagnajan (Red) is the king of the mighty Aksum empire. He has several outposts along the river where he is gathering his army for an attack on the kingdom of Darginda. It will take him long to prepare his army but once he is ready he might become unstoppable. Elephants and monks are amongst his troops so we are right to fear it."

BERBER1_INTRO_1 "711 AD, year 89 of the Hegira..."
BERBER1_INTRO_2 "I begin my tale as the winds throw the sands up into a centrifugal spiral, forcing the men and horses to take refuge and shield their eyes. I cannot help but notice how the camels stand tall, undaunted."
BERBER1_INTRO_3 "We are a people of the horse, but we have the resilience of camels as well. Invaders have swept through this land for centuries, and yet we Berbers have remained powerful and strong-willed."
BERBER1_INTRO_4 "Until now we have only rarely ventured outside of our homeland on the path of conquest. All of that is about to change. A man named Tariq ibn Ziyad has sowed the seeds of ambition in the minds of warriors and simple herdsmen alike, and we prepare for war."
BERBER1_INTRO_5 "Tariq is not as other men. Formerly a slave, he rose to be a brilliant general. Strong, charismatic, and tactful, he is also one of our own. Thousands of men flock to his banner, and men who formerly shunned the thought of venturing across the sea now eagerly board the ships destined for Iberia."
BERBER1_INTRO_6 "With Allah as my witness, I shall truthfully record the events to come, for good or ill."
BERBER1_OUTRO_1 "Wracked by fear and treachery, the slow Visigoth forces fell easily to our agile horsemen. Thousands of men lie dead, and although they were our enemies, the Visigoths fought valiantly and honorably. It is a melancholy thing to see their corpses left to the crows and wolves."
BERBER1_OUTRO_2 "As we entered the city of Cordoba, men stared in awe at the architecture and riches on display. Now is no time for resting, Tariq tells us. There is much left to be done."

BERBER2_INTRO_1 "712 AD, year 90 of the Hegira..."
BERBER2_INTRO_2 "Banners billow in the wind and the tips of spears glisten in the sun as hundreds of soldiers ride by. A horn sounds as the front of the column approaches a promontory overlooking a large, glorious city."
BERBER2_INTRO_3 "We have reached Toledo, the center of the Visigoth Kingdom. I can hardly believe my eyes at her beauty... a city worthy of a king. Tariq is determined that we capture Toledo quickly, before the neighboring cities have the chance to react."
BERBER2_INTRO_4 "The Visigoth heartland will be difficult to subdue. Opposing us, in addition to Toledo, are the cities of Seville, Merida, Talavera, and Guadalajara. Many of these cities date back to a time when the Romans still ruled these lands."
BERBER2_INTRO_5 "We are not alone, however. Tariq's former master, Musa ibn Nusayr, has landed in the south with a large army. If we can capture Toledo and hold out until Musa's soldiers arrive, we will crush the Visigoths with a two-pronged attack!"
BERBER2_OUTRO_1 "The Visigoth cities did not fall easily. These people truly fight like lions!"
BERBER2_OUTRO_2 "To breach the walls of Toledo, Tariq ordered the construction of two large armored rams with iron heads. These engines are indeed fearsome to behold... the gates of city after city crumbled before their might."
BERBER2_OUTRO_3 "A cloud of dust could be seen from miles away as Musa's army approached. After having breached the cities of Seville and Merida, they were laden down with the spoils of war. Both armies rejoiced at their success with much revelry."

BERBER3_INTRO_1 "713 AD, year 91 of the Hegira..."
BERBER3_INTRO_2 "The meeting between Tariq and Musa was strange to witness. The respect between the two is considerable, but there is an air of competition, of rivalry..."
BERBER3_INTRO_3 "They will not be robbed of their glory. Despite the order of the Caliph that Tariq and Musa return to Damascus, the two have begun to plan campaigns deeper into enemy territory. Dividing the army, Tariq strikes north, while Musa targets the city of Zaragoza."
BERBER3_INTRO_4 "A local Visigoth lord, Theodemir of Murcia, has pledged us his support. Home to a strong army and a thriving economy, Murcia will be a potent ally."
BERBER3_INTRO_5 "However, we have a new and dangerous enemy. Pelayo of Asturias, a Visigoth nobleman, has rallied what was a fractured resistance into a formidable adversary. In his dominion in Asturias, a large army gathers, preparing to attack."
BERBER3_INTRO_6 "If we can weather the storm that is sure to come, with the blessing of Allah we may even be able to conquer as far as Septimania!"
BERBER3_OUTRO_1 "Septimania and the Ebro valley have fallen beneath the heel of our glorious armies, but we have not achieved a complete victory. Tariq and Musa were forced to return to Damascus, and without their leadership we will find it difficult to defeat the Asturians."
BERBER3_OUTRO_2 "The future of the conquest looks bleak. I shall continue to chronicle the events ahead, though I fear that our land may fall victim to invasions and internal strife, like so many other kingdoms before us."

BERBER4_INTRO_1 "732 AD, year 110 of the Hegira..."
BERBER4_INTRO_2 "After many years, our people have finally found another glorious leader to follow. Seeking vengeance for the defeat of our armies at the hands of the Franks over ten years before, Abd ar-Rahman al-Ghafiqi has rallied our armies for another campaign."
BERBER4_INTRO_3 "Bred on the battlefield, al-Ghafiqi is no stranger to the ways of war. Having waged war on the Visigoths, Asturians, and Franks, his most recent exploit was the quelling of a rebellion by the Berber governor in Catalonia."
BERBER4_INTRO_4 "If we are to invade the land of the Franks, we must make a dangerous crossing of the Pyrenees. To arrive at the other side in time to start our campaign in the spring, we will be forced to start this journey in the dead of winter."
BERBER4_INTRO_5 "The rugged terrain is difficult for armies to cross, and ambushes will almost certainly be frequent. Many men will not survive the journey."
BERBER4_INTRO_6 "I grow old, but I will make this journey through the frigid mountains so that I might see another year of conquest."
BERBER4_OUTRO_1 "Truly, I have not endured such a trying journey in the entirety of my life. The cold and cruel winds were like nothing I have ever experienced, and the fear of enemy ambushes lurking behind every bend is enough to drive a man mad."
BERBER4_OUTRO_2 "Between the elements and enemy blades, many of our men perished on the crossing. Nevertheless, we arrived in considerable force on the other side. It is more than many hoped for."
BERBER4_OUTRO_3 "We have little time to rest and recover our strength. The Franks will not lie waiting forever."

BERBER5_INTRO_1 "732 AD, year 110 of the Hegira. A month since we crossed the Pyrenees..."
BERBER5_INTRO_2 "Our army advances into the heart of Aquitania, scouting the region as we move forward. Thick forests and open fields abound, and we made camp near a river crossing."
BERBER5_INTRO_3 "The Frankish army is powerful, but their cavalry cannot match ours as long as we fight on an open field. Using our mobility to our advantage will prove quite important in the battles ahead."
BERBER5_INTRO_4 "Al-Ghafiqi will risk no error. He has a score to settle with the Frankish count Odo of Aquitaine, the warlord who smashed an Umayyad army at Toulouse ten years prior. After such a long time, these two giants will finally meet again."
BERBER5_INTRO_5 "The Frankish lands are divided, their tendency to localism is no match for the organization of the Umayyad Caliphate. Capturing the city of Bordeaux will throw the region into chaos and allow us to pounce on the Frankish army as a cat would upon a mouse."
BERBER5_INTRO_6 "This will be the great razzia, or raid, of our time. I can only pray that we are up to the challenge."
BERBER5_OUTRO_1 "With the blessing of Allah, the horn announcing our success sings a loud, shrill tone that echoes over the countryside. Upon hearing of our approach, Odo’s army descended upon Bordeaux, only to fall beneath our hooves."
BERBER5_OUTRO_2 "Another Frankish army hastened south but was no match for our brave, seasoned warriors. A bloody battle ensued, and afterwards the Franks lamented their defeat, saying that God alone knows the number of the slain."
BERBER5_OUTRO_3 "With the Frankish army defeated, there is little standing between our glorious forces and eternal glory as the conquerors of Europe. For centuries, history will remember us as the courageous warriors who defeated countless kings."
BERBER5_OUTRO_4 "I daresay few would have thought so many years ago that any of this would be possible."

MALI1_INTRO_1 "You ask me if I know the epic of Sundjata, the great founder of the Malian Empire? Ha ha! You were right not to seek out any ordinary djeli. What is a djeli, you ask? You must not be from around here! A djeli is a historian, musician, poet, and storyteller! I am Kouyaté, djeli and historian of the royal family. Listen well, and I will tell you of this man, Sundjata."
MALI1_INTRO_2 "One day, a mysterious hunter arrived at the court of Naré Maghann Konaté, King of the Mandinkas. The hunter prophesied that an ugly woman would be brought to court to be presented as a bride. If the King accepted her she would bear him a son who would one day become the greatest king the Mandinkas had ever seen!"
MALI1_INTRO_3 "Years passed, and one day two hunters from the Do kingdom brought with them Sologon, an ugly woman, hunchbacked, with an offering of marriage. Konaté remembered the prophecy and accepted. Sologon gave birth to a son, Sundjata."
MALI1_INTRO_4 "For the first several years of his life, Sundjata could not stand upright. Through secret and magical arts, a blacksmith made a sturdy iron rod so that the boy might prop himself up on it, but even that broke beneath him. Only when Sundjata found a branch from the sacred Baobab tree did he finally take his first steps."
MALI1_INTRO_5 "Konaté's first wife seethed with jealousy, however. She saw no reason for this feeble son of a second wife to take the throne. In spite of the prophecy, she wished her son Dankaran, the eldest, to be the heir to the kingdom. When Konaté died, she exiled Sologon and Sundjata."
MALI1_INTRO_6 "They fled from land to land, but each kingdom feared the wrath of the new King Dankaran and would not harbor them. Only the Mema, far to the south, did not fear the Mandinka. They are a people of proud warriors, and among them Sundjata learned how to hunt and fight. He left his disability behind, and became as fierce and strong as a lion! Before long, he was ready to take back his rightful place on the throne."
MALI1_INTRO_7 "When he arrived, however, he found war already upon the kingdom: Sosso warriors from the far north had overrun the capital on the river, slaughtered the fearsome King Dankaran and all of the royal family, and claimed the land of the Mandinkas for their lord, Sumanguru!"
MALI1_OUTRO_1 "Sundjata barely escaped the raiding parties ravaging his homeland. As the only surviving man with a claim to the Mandinka throne, Sundjata would never truly be safe from the grasp of Sumanguru. Sundjata knew that he must tread carefully until the time was right, and hide from the Sosso scouts until he was strong enough to strike back!"

MALI2_INTRO_1 "Rumors described Sumanguru as a cruel tyrant and a sorcerer in command of powerful spirits. He was said to possess a magical balophon which would grant him victory if he played it. He could not be injured except with the spur of a rooster. The whispers abounded."
MALI2_INTRO_2 "Regardless of the rumors, he was above all an ambitious conqueror from the west seeking to seize the lands of the old empire of Ghana for his own. To this end, he moved his seat of power to Koumbi Saleh, once the capital and heart of that ancient kingdom."
MALI2_INTRO_3 "Sundjata knew that contesting such a man would be difficult. The Sosso had allied with other tribes in the north: the Jolof, the Diafanu, and others like them who made great gains from Sosso control of the Saharan trade. With such powerful allies, and even more powerful armies, no one dared to rise up against them."
MALI2_INTRO_4 "Sundjata had one advantage: he was still remembered as the crippled prince of the Mandinkas, still thought to be weaker than he really was. As long as this was to be believed, the Sosso would dismiss him as inconsequential, and he could form his own alliances."
MALI2_INTRO_5 "To provide proof of his miraculous transformation from crippled boy to strong prince, he took up the Boabab branch from his youth and began a journey. From people to people and kingdom to kingdom, he traveled to rally support – to prove he was strong enough to retake his lands from Sumanguru."
MALI2_OUTRO_1 "Sangaran, Labe, Niger, Tabon, and Wagadou. One by one, the kingdoms of the south and east rallied to Sundjata. They were small, however, and Sumanguru had conquered nine of similar size already. As successful as Sundjata had been, his coalition could not hope to defeat the Sosso just yet. Sundjata needed a better plan."


MALI3_INTRO_1 "As the sun sank between the trees, making its way ever closer to the horizon, a trader arrived. His turban and garments marked him as a foreigner long before he spoke. His thick accent betrayed his Arabic origins."
MALI3_INTRO_2 "He spoke of his desire to see the young prince on the throne, and boasted of the great deposits of gold in Sundjata’s lands. Even so, traders like him could not access it, not with Sumanguru in power. The tyrant had given his allies control over the gold and salt trades, and merchants were left at their mercy. The Arab spoke of the gold and salt trades as if they were the flowing blood of these kingdoms. If the blood no longer flows, the beast is dead."
MALI3_INTRO_3 "Sundjata thought for a long time about the merchant's words. The next day, he assembled a band of raiders. If trade was the blood of Sumanguru's empire, then Sundjata would attack its throat like a lion pouncing on its prey."
MALI3_OUTRO_1 "Sundjata raided with unbridled success. With trade diverted into Mandinka lands, allegiance to Sumanguru began to waver across his empire."
MALI3_OUTRO_2 "Sundjata put the gold he gained to good use, assuring that his people and allies profited from the new riches. He had proven himself not only an able commander, but also an able king. He enjoyed good relations with the Arab merchants and often invited Muslims to his court. Eventually, Sundjata himself converted to their faith."
MALI3_OUTRO_3 "With his newfound successes came greater attention, though. Every city in West Africa bellowed the name of Sundjata the Lion, King of the Mandinkas, the King of Mali. Sumanguru could no longer afford to dismiss the once-crippled prince. He assembled his armies for war."

MALI4_INTRO_1 "A beast is most dangerous when cornered. Sumanguru was no different."
MALI4_INTRO_2 "He struck southward into the Kangaba heartland, where he had slaughtered the Mandinka royal family once before. He was rumored to have brought his mystical balophon with him to summon victory, and djelis were already singing that the battle had been won by the sorcerer before it even began."
MALI4_INTRO_3 "Sundjata met him by the Niger River, at a place called Kirina. Loyal Sosso and Jolof warriors stood tall, banging their shields and grinning at the soldiers of the Malian alliance. Horses and camels kicked up enough sand to shroud the sun at noon. Sumanguru himself took the field in the dusty twilight, and Sundjata faced him from across the hot expanse. As the armies prepared to charge, the music of a balophon began to flow through the air."
MALI4_INTRO_4 "The decisive moment was at hand, and all of west Africa awaited the victor."
MALI4_OUTRO_1 "The armies crashed against each other. They buckled and wrenched, bristling serpents coiling and writhing amidst the clamor of weapons and rumble of hooves. Many times the Malian soldiers faltered, but at the critical moment Sundjata would ride across the lines to rally his men, inspiring them to push on and prevail."
MALI4_OUTRO_2 "At long last, the Sosso onslaught slowed and their resolve began to fade. Sensing that the tide had turned, Sumanguru abandoned his men and fled into the mountains. At the sight of their leader in flight, the exhausted Sosso lines collapsed."
MALI4_OUTRO_3 "The ensuing celebrations lasted for days, with feasts of such bounty as were not seen before nor ever since. All the kings of the coalition gathered to proclaim Sundjata their Mansa, the King of Kings. Mali had become an empire, and Sundjata its emperor."

MALI5_INTRO_1 "Mali now dominated the land on both sides of the great river. Mansa Sundjata reigned freely from the gold mines of Bambuk to the city of Gao, but it was not enough. Sumanguru fled to his stronghold of Koumbi Saleh, still wreaking havoc wherever he could. As long as he lived, he would be a threat to the peace of the realm."
MALI5_INTRO_2 "Sundjata called upon his men once again and began a long siege of the mighty Sosso capital, the former seat of the Ghanese empire. Sundjata would not be denied his final victory."
MALI5_OUTRO_1 "With peace in the empire and his ancestors avenged, Mansa Sundjata settled well into his role as the ruler of Mali. In peace he was as effective an emperor as he was in war, building markets and mosques across his lands. He was a model for all emperors to follow, making his country a center of learning and culture at the edge of the Sahara. For centuries afterward peace and stability reigned."
MALI5_OUTRO_2 "And so I remain to tell his story. Balafasseke Kouyaté is my name, his humble family historian, a djeli of superb bloodline and patronage. And this is Sumanguru’s balophon, which I stole before the battle at Kirina, and played that day to inspire the victory of Sundjata!"

ALMEIDA1_INTRO_1 "My captain is dead. Tell King Manuel that the red blood of Francisco de Almeida, conqueror of the Indies, stains a white beach at the edge of his empire. After braving Spanish knights, Berber horsemen, and Indian elephants, it was the King's lost faith in a devoted servant that took his life's breath."
ALMEIDA1_INTRO_2 "Lies they whispered in our King's ear! They called Dom Francisco mad with lust for power, riches, and glory. Those jackals! Those men who had never set foot on a swaying caravel in a monsoon or felt the heat of the African sun sting upon a reddened neck! Was not my captain's devotion measured in the sweat and blood he poured across three continents and three oceans?"
ALMEIDA1_INTRO_3 "I was a boy when the battlefield of Toro birthed the legend of Dom Francisco. While the last of the Moors held in Granada, the Christian kingdoms of Iberia warred for the throne of Castile. King Henry had died, leaving his kingdom to his daughter Juana, wife of King Afonso of Portugal. The union of the two lands was celebrated in our country but, for the ambition of a queen, it was not to be..."
ALMEIDA1_INTRO_4 "Queen Juana's twenty-five year old aunt, Isabella, sought the throne for herself. Her powerful husband, the King of Aragon, led his army into Castile to seize the crown for his wife and unite that kingdom with his own. The armies of Aragon and Portugal met near the city of Toro to decide the fate of three kingdoms..."
ALMEIDA1_OUTRO_1 "Despite the successes of Dom Francisco and Prince Juan, the Battle of Toro was indecisive. After three more years of war, a compromise was reached. Isabella was crowned Queen of Castile, uniting that kingdom with Aragon into a unified Spain. In exchange, the wise King Afonso, attuned to the changing times, received Spanish assurances that the African coast and the waters and lands to the East were a Portuguese dominion."

ALMEIDA2_INTRO_1 "I began my journey with Dom Francisco two decades ago in Morocco. Thirteen years had passed since the Battle of Toro and the grizzled soldier had risen to be an esteemed counselor to King Juan. Courtly life did not suit my captain well, however. He convinced the King to send him to Africa to fight the Moors."
ALMEIDA2_INTRO_2 "King Afonso had conquered the Tangier coast before the war with Aragon but Portugal's hold on Muslim Africa was tenuous. Barbary pirates menaced the coast and Berber tribesmen emerged from the lifeless deserts in fierce raids."
ALMEIDA2_INTRO_3 "Against these predators stood a fragile outpost of Christendom on an island in the Loukkos River. The garrison was led by a soldier named Afonso de Albuquerque whose path would cross with ours again in a different world. My captain set sail to take command of this garrison and re-establish Portugal's hold on Tangier. It would not be the last time that Dom Francisco carried the flag of Portugal to the dangerous edges of the Christian world."
ALMEIDA2_OUTRO_1 "While we fought the centuries-old war against the Moors in North Africa, other sons of Portugal were the pioneers of a new age. On small leaky caravels, they took the first daring steps from Europe and lifted the shroud that had obscured our understanding of the wider world for a millennium. The world was vast, far vaster than we had ever imagined, but men like Bartolomeu Dias and Vasco da Gama reached distant shores and gave us the first glimmers of a coming global Empire."
ALMEIDA2_OUTRO_2 "The Turks and Moors might flash their scimitars over the Mediterranean but they wore no armor on their backs. There, in the Indian Ocean, an ancient trade flourished to the enrichment of the Muslim world. Armed with cannons and ships built to withstand the storms of the Atlantic, the sons of Portugal would fall upon this world like a famished lion in the fold."

ALMEIDA3_INTRO_1 "It was five years ago that I went with Dom Francisco to the Indies. His appointment to the Viceroyship of India by the young King Manuel had shocked the Portuguese court. Dom Francisco was the champion of King Juan, the deceased cousin of the recently crowned King, and the Almeidas had favored a rival claimant to the Portuguese throne. The King's intentions were the topic of many hushed whispers."
ALMEIDA3_INTRO_2 "We sailed for many months across the edge of the world, preyed upon by pirates, storms, and disease. But as our leaky ships rounded the southern cape of Africa, we saw the first glimmers of the riches of the Orient. Three mighty citadels guarded the lucrative trade waters of the Swahili coast where merchants traded ivory, gold, spices, and jewels from the innards of Africa to the fringes of faraway China."
ALMEIDA3_INTRO_3 "Weathered by the long voyage, Dom Francisco sought trade and hospitality from the first of these citadels but her stubborn ruler, a usurper who had slain the rightful sultan, arrogantly closed his gates to us. Finding an exiled African prince with ties to a rebel army, my captain cunningly hatched a plan to take the Swahili coast by fire and steel."
ALMEIDA3_OUTRO_1 "Empires are built on the ruins of dead empires. The pile of burnt stone we left in Mombasa, once a palace, was the foundation for the new Empire of Portugal. Our conquest of the Swahili coast sent waves across the Indian Ocean to the wealthy trading cities of Zanzibar, Mogadishu, Calicut, and others. We were met with either fearful gifts or the closed gates of those with the foolishness to challenge our cannons. Few would continue to make that mistake."

ALMEIDA4_INTRO_1 "After months at sea, we reached our goal: the rich Malabar coast of India, land of a thousand gods, and a haven for spices, gold, and silver. In the brackish lagoons of Kerala, among temples dedicated to strange serpent gods, we established our trading posts in the cities of Cannanore and Cochin."
ALMEIDA4_INTRO_2 "From these cities, my captain and his son Lourenco cunningly manipulated the feuding rajas and sultans. They maneuvered through the politics of spice and faith, always with an eye for the most profitable outcome. One Hindu prince, however, defied us."
ALMEIDA4_INTRO_3 "This nameless ruler of Calicut, known only by the title 'the Zamorin', threatened to break the carefully crafted deals and rivalries from which Portugal profited. By sword and shrewd tongue, giving no credence to differences of religion or race, he gained allies in the rajas, in the sultans, and in rulers as far away as Egypt and Venice."
ALMEIDA4_INTRO_4 "Even our own allies among the Indians fell for his intrigue. The treacherous Kolathiri Raja, prince of Cannanore, betrayed us for the Zamorin's gold. Surrounded by enemies, it seemed the hands of fate had turned so quickly against us."
ALMEIDA4_OUTRO_1 "Though the Zamorin limped away from Cannanore bloodied, his resolve was untouched by our cannons."
ALMEIDA4_OUTRO_2 "In driving men to war, gold can be more powerful than God. For centuries, the wealth of the Indies had passed through the Indian Ocean, carried by Arab, Indian, and Somali merchants to the port cities of Arabia, Egypt, and Africa. From there, endless caravans carried wealth across the desert to Alexandria and then to Istanbul, Venice, and Genoa."
ALMEIDA4_OUTRO_3 "By rounding Africa, Portuguese traders had upset the traditional balance of this world. With our forts in India, we cut the trade that had enriched the Muslim sultans and the Venetian doge alike. Dom Francisco held a knife to the throat of our enemies and as the lion fed, vultures and jackals appeared."

ALMEIDA5_INTRO_1 "We had taken the other side of the world by storm but our old enemies followed. As the Zamorin beat his war drums, Ottomans and Egyptians rallied to him. Their ships were carried over the desert and rebuilt by treacherous Venetians. In India, an unlikely Russian renegade called Malik Ayyaz raised the Muslim armies of Gujarat in defense of the Hindu Zamorin. Gold had truly become more powerful than God."
ALMEIDA5_INTRO_2 "As this coalition of Hindus, Muslims, and Christians descended on us, liars and jackals flocked to the court of King Manuel. They filled his ears with lies that Dom Francisco had betrayed Portugal and convinced the young King to dispatch an Armada led by Afonso de Albuquerque to relieve my captain of the Viceroyship. Dom Francisco, however, was in no mood for politics."
ALMEIDA5_INTRO_3 "Tragedy struck off the coast of Chaul. In a heroic naval battle, my captain's beloved son Lourenco was slain by Amir Husain, admiral of the Mamluk fleet of Egypt. Though he deeply loved his son, Dom Francisco did not shed tears for his death. In repayment, my captain vowed to shed blood. "
ALMEIDA5_OUTRO_1 "With his son's death avenged, Dom Francisco surrendered the Viceroyship of India and wrote his final chapter. He would not return to his beloved Portugal. Landing in southern Africa to collect water, his party was ambushed by the Khoikhoi natives. We found his body on that forsaken white beach."
ALMEIDA5_OUTRO_2 "In the five years since we departed Lisbon, we followed Dom Francisco to the edge of the Earth. We fought ebony-skinned warriors in the jungles and savannas of Africa, battled Mamluk sailors on the decks of galleys heaving in the monsoon waves, and struggled against armies of elephants and camels in the sprawling cities of India. Our caravels had taken us to the distant shores unknown to our ancestors and awoken Europe to a world beyond our dreams."

YODIT1_INTRO_1 "Aksum - the heart of our empire and the cradle of Ethiopian civilization and culture since antiquity. Even so, every time our caravan stops here to sell its wares and acquire necessities for the village, the city seems less grand: more roofs need thatching, less shops are open, and even the shouts of the hawkers are ever so slightly less audible."
YODIT1_INTRO_2 "My son Daniel doesn't notice, of course. For his twelfth birthday, I promised that he could travel with the yearly caravan and see Aksum for himself. Ever since we entered the city, the boy has stared in awe at every building. The city is indeed a marvelous sight for a country lad living in the northern highlands."
YODIT1_INTRO_3 "As we passed a temple, Daniel abruptly stopped. 'Father', he whispered, his eyes fixed on the golden curtains, 'have you ever seen such a treasure? Why does nobody guard it - are they not afraid of thieves?' I could not help but smile before replying 'Why hire strong-arms when even the queen dares not take them, my son?' A deep frown creased Daniel's brow: 'Don't you lie to me, father! Surely a queen can do whatever she wishes'."
YODIT1_INTRO_4 "The boy apparently did not know the story of his ruler yet - that needed to change. 'Sit down, son', I responded, directing Daniel to the stairs of the temple, 'Forty years ago, when our queen Yodit was but a princess, she discovered the very reason why those curtains do not need any guards...'"
YODIT1_INTRO_5 "The boy sat down, leaning close to hear the beginning of what was sure to be a truly wondrous story. 'Yodit was truly beautiful. Every lord in the empire contended for her hand, much to the displeasure of Gidajan, her nephew and the heir to the throne. Gidajan devised a plan to be rid of her: in the night he stole the golden curtains and hid them in her room. When the palace guard discovered the treasure, she was locked in the deepest cells.'"
YODIT1_INTRO_6 "Daniel gasped loudly, but quickly covered his mouth and urged me to go on, 'Luckily, there were some who refused to believe the accusations. One loyal captain, named Samuel, helped her escape through a secret tunnel. As long as she stayed in the Aksumite Empire, Yodit would never be safe from prince Gidajan. Her journey had merely begun...'"
YODIT1_OUTRO_1 "Daniel laughed with joy: 'I knew Yodit would escape prince Gidajan!' After a few seconds, his face became more serious. 'But how did she become queen if she left Ethiopia, father?' he finally asked. 'Indeed a good question, Daniel, but we must be going', I responded while lifting him up. 'The sun is already descending and we still need to visit the market. Mother will not be pleased if we return to the village without a gift for her. If you help me find one, I will tell you how Yodit fared in exile.' That promise put the smile back on the lad's face."

YODIT2_INTRO_1 "Despite the late hour, the market of Aksum was still crowded. Vendors shouted from several wooden stalls, describing their goods: bolts of silk from the Far East, olibanum incense from Arabia, bracelets made from Egyptian glass, our own Ethiopian ivory, ... products from all over the world have been exchanged in the city since ancient times."
YODIT2_INTRO_2 "At every stall, Daniel was enthralled by some exotic item he had never seen before – not a very good situation to start bargaining, but I could not spoil his mood just to save a few coins. In the end, we settled on some beautiful, golden earrings for mother. She had always liked jewelry. 'Father', Daniel asked me just after the purchase, 'you promised to tell me the story of Yodit's exile once we bought a present for mother.'"
YODIT2_INTRO_3 "So there we were, sitting on some low wall next to a shop. I was tired from browsing all of the stalls, but a man should keep his word, especially to his son."
YODIT2_INTRO_4 "Sighing, I began: 'Yodit traveled north for many years, searching for someone who could help her seek revenge for the humiliation she had suffered at the hands of Gidajan. Eventually, when making camp near the border of Egypt, the princess heard a rumor that perhaps presented the opportunity she had been awaiting. The Syrian prince Zanobis was traveling the region, looking for a suitable bride. But how could she, an exiled princess, convince such a powerful man?'"
YODIT2_OUTRO_1 "'Of course, Zanobis was impressed by Yodit's achievements. He went looking for this famous princess and asked her to marry him', I concluded. Smiling broadly, Daniel responded: 'Queen Yodit is truly a strong woman, father. But how did she...' I quickly raised my hand to stop him: 'No, son. No more questions now."
YODIT2_OUTRO_2 "It will soon be dark and we need to return to the inn. A meal will do us both much good.' Daniel looked disappointed. My, the boy was fond of this story! 'Perhaps I'll tell you about one of her great victories before going to bed', I conceded before leaving the market."

YODIT3_INTRO_1 "The trade mission in Aksum was quite successful. I sold all of my grain and bought some casks of wine, olive oil and spices. Those goods would be sure to fetch a good price at home. Perhaps I will even be able to afford another cow? The door opened with a loud creak as Daniel returned from checking on the camels."
YODIT3_INTRO_2 "I looked up from the accounts and rubbed my eyes, tired from reading by the light of a single candle. 'Everything alright with the camels?' I said to greet the boy. He only nodded, so I continued 'Perhaps we should go to bed. The caravan will leave early tomorrow and we have a long way back home.' Daniel barely suppressed a yawn before answering. 'I am not really tired, father, but since you said you would tell a bedtime story about Yodit, I had might as well go to sleep early.'"
YODIT3_INTRO_3 "The room was decent and clean, but small. There was only one bed for both of us, as renting two rooms in the city would have been expensive. I took my shirt off and lay down next to Daniel before resuming the story: 'After marrying prince Zanobis, Yodit had to be patient for her vengeance. Her husband had to become king and build a larger army if they ever were to defeat the mighty Aksumite Empire.'"
YODIT3_INTRO_4 "The boy suppressed another yawn, but then turned his head to listen closely. 'Five years had passed since Zanobis had taken the throne when Yodit learned that the Aksumite king, Dagnajan, was planning a military expedition to the east. If she could send an elite force to ambush and kill Dagnajan, the Aksumite empire would be severely crippled. A daring, but promising plan.'"
YODIT3_OUTRO_1 "'When the news of Dagnajan's death reached the city of Aksum, both of his sons tried to seize the throne for themselves. A civil war broke out and the once so mighty empire began to crumble. Of course, Yodit...', a soft snoring drew my attention to Daniel. The lad was already sleeping."

YODIT4_INTRO_1 "Outside the northern gate the camels groaned, irritated by the traders mounting the animals to begin the long journey back to the Ethiopian highlands. Daniel was already in the saddle, keeping a firm hand on the reins to avoid the camel from wandering off. He looked eager to return home."
YODIT4_INTRO_2 "Drivers urged their animals forward with loud shouts and cracking whips. Slowly, the long-stretched caravan began to move. As I took my place next to my son, the sun slowly began to rise above the hills. Not far from the gate, we passed a field of great stelae. Some stood tall, reaching for the sky, but most lay toppled, their pieces scattered over the ground."
YODIT4_INTRO_3 "'Father', Daniel asked, looking up at a towering stele, 'when we entered the city you told me that these stones marked the graves of ancient kings. Do you think Dagnajan is buried here as well?' I shook my head while answering: 'No, my son. Those kings are long dead. Christian kings never used stelae to mark their burial place. Besides, the body of Danganjan was never recovered. His two sons were far too busy trying to slay each other.'"
YODIT4_INTRO_4 "'So you told me last night', Daniel replied, suddenly remembering yesterday's story. 'A perfect opportunity for Yodit to strike! Oh, father, tell me all about it!' I shifted my weight to sit more comfortably in the saddle before beginning: 'While the Aksumite Empire was divided in civil war between the brothers, Yodit ordered a fleet to be built. An invading force would cross the Red Sea and strike hard at Massawa, the most important harbor of the empire.'"
YODIT4_OUTRO_1 "'Although Gidajan had managed to kill his brother and take the throne in the meantime, he had also lost the north to Yodit. Soon she would advance to the capital for the final battle.' Daniel whistled through his teeth as I finished. 'That must have been an exciting time to be alive, father', he exclaimed in admiration."
YODIT4_OUTRO_2 "Before I could dispel his youthful naiveté about warfare, shouts arose from the front of the caravan to stop for the night. Had I actually spoken for the entire day?"

YODIT5_INTRO_1 "The caravan had stopped at the top of a hill after a long day of traveling. The setting sun cast an orange light on the city of Aksum in the valley below. Some merchants sat around the campfire, sharing wineskins and roasting a goat. Others were already pitching their tents. Up here, the nights could be very cold."
YODIT5_INTRO_2 "'It's strange how the city looks so small from above, as if I could pick it up with one hand,' Daniel remarked. Lost in my thoughts, I had not heard the boy return from watering and feeding our camels. 'Wait until you get back home, son, for our village will look smaller still', I replied, smiling. 'Come, let us join the campfire and have some dinner. I am starving.'"
YODIT5_INTRO_3 "Daniel had just finished his portion of goat. 'Father, would you finally tell me how Yodit became queen of Aksum?' he requested. Wiping some grease from my chin, I began to protest. Before I could finish, however, Tariku, an old, lean merchant with white hair, stood up. He stared fiercely at Daniel with his one eye. 'So you want to hear about our good queen, lad?' he asked in his leathery voice."
YODIT5_INTRO_4 "All of the men around the fire were silent and Daniel shifted nervously beside me. I gave his hand a squeeze to comfort him. 'Tariku fought against Yodit's troops in Aksum', I whispered to my son. Daniel could only nod to the one-eyed man. 'Thirty years ago', Tariku began solemnly, 'I was patrolling the northern hills of Aksum when suddenly I saw a sea of banners in the distance. The sun reflected upon rows of armored men. Yodit had finally arrived to destroy the cradle of Ethiopian civilization! I shivered, for her fury was legendary...'"
YODIT5_OUTRO_1 "'I saw how Gidajan finally fell, his body covered with blood. He was wrong to kill his brother, yes, but he was the rightful heir to the throne!' Tariku was almost shouting, his body shaking with anger. After some silence he continued in a soft voice: 'I tried to defend my homeland from disaster and lost my eye for it. A small price for such an honor."
YODIT5_OUTRO_2 "Now you remember this well, boy,' he implored, looking directly at Daniel, 'Yodit's rise to the throne was not some glorious adventure - it was a bloody mess.' The old man leaned back, sighing. Glancing at my son, I noticed that he suddenly seemed older than he had this morning. Nobody dared to whisper another word."

ALARIC1_INTRO_1 "The nightmare is always the same. I shiver awake, watching the arrows rain down. I can feel the heat of burning tents. Hooves clatter, swords crash together, and bodies tumble into the dust. I can smell death. My three brothers lost their lives defending our tribe from the Hunnic raids.\n\nOn those nights I would roll close to Alaric. I touched every scar and remembered the sacrifices he made for his people. I loved him deeply, my husband and my king. Never before had the Goths been led by such a great man."
ALARIC1_INTRO_2 "After the Hunnic invasion Alaric left our tribe to join the Roman army. Like so many of our young men, he longed for revenge. With his exceptional strength and cunning mind, his reputation grew, and soon he led centuries of men. But the Romans are treacherous masters.\n\nAlaric grew weary of false promises of gold and land. While he fought the wars of other men hundreds of leagues away, we wandered, homeless. I still remember the thousands of campfires shining through the dark nights. When he did return, he rarely spoke. He stared embittered into the campfire as if he saw God staring back, just as silently."
ALARIC1_INTRO_3 "Then one day everything changed. He swept into camp, took me in his arms, and kissed me like never before. And he laughed.\n\n\"Stilicho has agreed to a deal!”\n\n\"The Roman general?” I replied. \"The one you've been butting heads against all these years? Why would he make a deal now?” \n\nHe gave me a cryptic smile. \"There are always conspiracies in Rome, plays for power.” He said. \"But our people need land here and now, in Thrace. For that, I would make a deal even with Stilicho. He is willing to give it to us.”"
ALARIC1_INTRO_4 "That night was filled with music and laughter, the joy of a thousand Gothic camps. Their king had found them a new home. But the pendulum of Roman conspiracy swings both ways. The campfires of that happy night soon smoldered to ashes. Our hopes followed when the refugees began pouring in. Children, widows, destitute masses of bleeding people, all terrified for their lives and exhausted from flight. It was then we heard: the Senate had found out about Stilicho and his deal. They killed him, and slaughtered every \"barbarian” they found in Rome. Come morning, legions of Goths marched from camp, once again fighting for Rome: they would fight the Romans for it."
ALARIC2_INTRO_1 "I awoke from another nightmare. Even the sun felt cold. Children played in the creek, grasshoppers sang in the meadow, but I could not smile like I used to. \n\nYears had passed since Alaric's return, since he brought us the riches of Rome. We retreated at Honorius' bidding and patiently awaited the grants of land for which we so longed. We stayed in Tuscia, always on watch for that messenger, the Roman who would tell us that the time to settle had come. Alaric made sure we could be ready at any moment. We seemed the wealthiest people on earth, bedecked in finery, parading about a camp as though it were a villa. But the months wore on, and the shine of gold faded. My nightmares began anew."
ALARIC2_INTRO_2 "Blood and bodies, thousands of them. Goths and Romans lie across the field like fallen trees after the fire. Ravens and vultures descend in clouds upon the faces and limbs, feasting. And in the center stands my Alaric, hideous and vengeful, rage on his brow. And in his eyes... nothing. Emptiness. I feared then that the gods were speaking to me, but I dismissed it. There could be no such horror. Not from my husband. Never from Alaric.\n\nUntil that day."
ALARIC3_INTRO_1 "I was beautiful in my youth. Boys fawned over me. As the years have passed, so has my beauty. My skin wrinkles and my hair turns ashen grey. The girl became an elder wife. But beauty gone is replaced by wisdom – or so we Goths believe. We are the followers of Arius, and his Christ. The Romans call us heretics. Perhaps this is why they treat us so, why they break their accords and slaughter us like animals. Yet God must love us, or we would not have survived this long against Latin treachery. Surely Rome must think so too, for there is unrest in the Senate. We soon received word that the Senate had elected a new emperor to usurp Honorius, a Greek named Attalus."
ALARIC3_INTRO_2 "The elders once told me that God sends signs of His will, and if we are wise then we can determine His path. \"Do you believe in the omens of God?” They asked. If the omens of God pointed us again to Rome, then Alaric would tread upon the seven hills again. In Greece we once had safe harbor in times of trouble, and now a Greek sat poised to overthrow Honorius. Alaric threw his support behind Attalus, and we immediately set off for Rome."
ALARIC3_INTRO_3 "Our soldiers ached for revenge, and a Rome divided between two emperors seemed the fattest hen to be plucked. Yet when we reached the city, Alaric merely talked. For ten months we stayed, bustling about the villas and mansions, talking and dining. I confess, Rome fascinated me. The streets were coarse, paved with stone, the baths steamed hot, and the sweet smell of baked bread mingled with the odor of refuse from the tenements. The city teemed with innumerable citizens, and every citizen had many servants. Yet our soldiers grew restless. There was no war, only silence from Honorius."
ALARIC3_INTRO_4 "We soon found out why: Honorius had closed the ports in Egypt. Grain supplies steadily dwindled and whispers of famine arose. Rome's new emperor could do nothing. War so far away would be too costly, and there was no food to spare for a campaign. The populous began to panic, and an impotent Attalus could only watch. Alaric paced our rooms at night, muttering to God about why He had led him again to Rome. I shuddered at his conclusion."
ALARIC3_INTRO_5 "Alaric went before the entire city the next day, and in front of the people and the Senators he stripped Attalus of his ranks, his titles, all the trappings of Emperor. I did not sleep for many nights after. Between the Gothic men who longed for the successful removal of Honorius and the shock of Rome that a barbarian king would dare affront the authority of the Senate, I knew not who I feared more."
ALARIC3_INTRO_6 "The response Alaric anticipated soon came, in the form of a simple stylus delivered by imperial courier. It bore Honorius's seal in splattered red wax, like blood on the text. The emperor thanked him for disposing of the imposter, and negotiations for Alaric's demands would recommence at the fortress of Ravenna immediately. I could not stomach the thought of him trusting Honorius again, and the betrayal of a Greek, a friend, weighed heavily on my soul. But soon Alaric was gone, and I was left staring at that red-sealed tablet... \"Do you believe in the omens of God?”"
ALARIC4_INTRO_1 "\"Arms and the man I sing, who first made way, predestined exile, from the Trojan shore to Italy, the blest Lavinian strand. Smitten of storms he was on land and sea by violence of Heaven, to satisfy stern Juno's sleepless wrath; and much in war he suffered.”\n\n– Virgilius, from the Aeneid. While I cannot read his words myself, I have had his works read to me. While in the shadow of their treacherous land the words of Romans provide the perfect voice to the meaning of their deceit. I may despise the people, but the books I took from Rome give me solace."
ALARIC4_INTRO_2 "The ambush of Sarus still a fresh memory, my husband took more and more the council of his brother, Athaulf. Hot-headed and daring, Athaulf ever mistrusted the Romans, and fought beside Alaric in many contests. They had shed and drawn blood together. Through burden of war and wrath of God Alaric still hoped for an end to the trials he faced. He hoped for peace at last, and a home for his people. And now Athaulf convinced Alaric to finally end the conflict with the unthinkable action: Rome must fall."
ALARIC4_INTRO_3 "If you have never heard the sound of forty-thousand men assembling for war, you could never imagine it. Horses braying, weapons clattering, hammers striking, wagons creaking, and above all the talk of men. Sometimes solemn, sometimes joking, sometimes fearful. As he donned his armor, my Alaric scanned the blue sky of the perfect morning. I heard the ghost of my husband's voice that day, wrought with despair. \"God have mercy on us for what we must do.” He whispered. \"His city will burn.”"
DRACULA1_INTRO_1 "We could not make camp in the damp and wet forest glade, so I led my companions towards the base of the mountain. Moving closer, I noticed an old path leading along its side. It was overgrown with bushes and all manner of foliage, and the footing was difficult. One could sight armor and weapons from time to time along the path, and stakes stood tall, covered with vines and moss. Glancing around, I spotted a magnificent blade."
DRACULA1_INTRO_2 "Light yet firm and unblemished by the elements, it shone in the rain and lightning, seeming to illuminate the darkening trail as we walked. The hilt was fashioned from what seemed to be steel inlaid with silver, copper, and gold to form the figure of a wingless yet defiant drake, a torrent of flame spewing from its mouth. The scabbard was equally ornate and from it emanated a feeling of power, majesty, but also ruthlessness."
DRACULA1_INTRO_3 "Reaching the summit, I could not believe my eyes. A ruined yet nonetheless imposing castle loomed above us, clearly a relic of a past era. Quietly rejoicing, my comrades moved towards their new camp, ready to roast their well-earned dinner. Then we heard the howls and growls. Two massive wolves bounded out the door of the castle towards the soldiers in front that stood dumbfounded by the sheer size of the creatures."
DRACULA1_INTRO_4 "Fearing for their lives, they drew weapons, only to hear a voice from the shadows speak to the wolves--or the men, we couldn't tell. A thick Wallachian accent was laced with Magyar, Szekely, and Bulgar influences, and it was clear that this man had seen much of the Carpathian basin. \"Stand down, fellows!\" he commanded. Throwing large slabs of meat to the ravenous wolves, he calmed them and satiated their hunger."
DRACULA1_INTRO_5 "Then he turned to my comrades and myself, and spoke. \"Welcome to Poenari Castle, the ancient stronghold and home of Vlad Dracula.\" I asked: \"Friend, can you offer us shelter here for the night?\" The mysterious man turned around and raised his hands in a gesture of welcome. \"It is well that you have come, for I have longed to share a story of mine. Come inside, fellows, sit by the fire and feast while I tell you the story of Vlad Dracula.\""
DRACULA2_INTRO_1 "\"Dracula knew that he needed to realign himself with the Hungarians and enlist their aid against Vladislav II, whose policies favored the Ottomans as well. His father had made a mistake in siding with the Ottomans, alienating himself from the cause that he had once sworn a holy oath to follow. Dracula was different. He remembered his education under the Order of the Dragon, and wanted to honor his vows.”"
DRACULA2_INTRO_2 "\"In addition, the Order was a powerful ally, and their elite crusader knights could be put to fine use fighting the armies of the Turks and the usurper Vladislav II. As Dracula, Jakub, Danislav, and Istvan walked the streets of the Moldavian port, Dracula mused over his plan to reclaim his kingdom.\" I rose up to take another slab of venison as the mysterious old man paused his tale. One of my comrades then asked:"
DRACULA2_INTRO_3 "\"So what happened next, friend? How was Dracula able to reclaim his rightful throne?\" The old man looked into the fire for a moment, watching the flames dance as if they were soldiers themselves, involved in a raging battle. A spark lit in his eyes again as a thought entered his mind, and he grasped the sword that his guests had brought to him. It shone in the light of the fire, and the ornate hilt looked as majestic as ever."
DRACULA2_INTRO_4 "\"Meanwhile, Sultan Murad II had died and was succeeded by his son, Mehmed II. Dracula utterly loathed Mehmed from their time together at the Ottoman court at Edirne, and he was doubtless that Mehmed's Turks would be a thorn in his side for years to come. However, the Turks were distracted at the moment. In 1453, they had conquered Constantinople, and they were presently occupied with campaigns in Greece and Serbia.”"
DRACULA2_INTRO_5 "\"Bogdan II, Dracula's cousin and the new Voivod of Moldavia, had heard of the exile and betrayal faced by his kinsman. He wanted to see his fellow Draculesti seated on the Wallachian throne, and he had the armies and resources to do it. If Dracula could get across the Carpathian Mountains to Transylvania and ally with Hungary, then they could launch a three-pronged assault on Danesti Wallachia and the Turkish holdings there.”"
DRACULA3_INTRO_1 "\"The punishment for all crime and dishonesty was death—impalement to be specific, for Dracula needed to make an example of criminals just as he did with Vladislav II and the Danesti clan. Under Dracula's strong rule, trade was reopened, the economy flourished, and Wallachia was utterly void of crime. Dracula was proud of his achievement, and placed a golden cup in the central square of Targoviste.”"
DRACULA3_INTRO_2 "\"The cup was never once touched throughout his reign. However, Dracula was angered by vagrancy and begging, so he had all of the poor and sick boarded up in a hall and then had the building set on fire!\" I was shocked. \"The fear of the stake was enough to prevent crime, I'm sure, but how was Dracula able to strengthen the economy and evade the plots of the Boyars at the same time?\""
DRACULA3_INTRO_3 "Smiling the whole time, his host continued: \"Dracula's restructuring was almost complete, but he was still faced with the problem of the Boyars. Dracula invited them all to a feast, and asked them how many Voivods they had seen in their lifetime. None had seen fewer than seven reigns, while some had even seen thirty! Furious, Dracula arrested all of the Boyars, and marched them here, to the former ruin of Poenari Castle!”"
DRACULA3_INTRO_4 "\"For months they labored, rebuilding the castle and toiling after their clothes fell off! Finally, the Poenari Castle was rebuilt, and Dracula celebrated by impaling all Boyars who survived the ordeal! Finally, Dracula had eradicated the fickle, conniving Boyars, and he was eager to put his own aristocracy in place. Knights and common peasants alike were made lords and given lands based on their loyalty to Dracula."
DRACULA3_INTRO_5 "Between their inherent loyalty to Dracula and the fear of the stake, none ever dared rebel. Strong again, the Dragon was ready to breathe a flame that would engulf his enemies, the Turks. Hearing wind of the movements of a Turkish army, he led his grand army out to meet them in combat. The first glorious battle would be fought at a mountain pass northwest of the fortress of Giurgiu…\""
DRACULA4_INTRO_1 "\"What sparked further conflict between Vlad and the Turks?\" I asked. He looked into his palm, as if there was something important that he had forgotten at the moment. \"Dracula never breathed a word of it, but many began to think of his experience at the Ottoman court. Certainly the betrayal of his brother Radu must have affected him- after all, anybody would be confused and angry after their own brother deserted his true family.\""
DRACULA4_INTRO_2 "\"Dracula also had his vows to consider, for he was at that point one of the higher-ranking members of the Order of the Dragon, and therefore answered to the Pope and the Hungarian regent. Both of these men desired war with the Turks.\" I nodded my head in understanding, thinking of all I had never known before tonight, trying to piece it all together."
DRACULA4_INTRO_3 "\"In the year 1462, the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II renewed his efforts, and, because he was besieging Corinth, sent his Grand Vizier with a force of 18,000 in his place. Hoping that Dracula would be unable to mobilize his army quickly enough, the Sultan thought that he could take Wallachia by storm with this small force. He was, of course, sadly mistaken,” our host chuckled, erupting into a fit of manic laughter."
DRACULA4_INTRO_4 "Our focus all back on our host, we watched him intently. I had heard several stories of the Danube butchering, but never a firsthand account. As ever, I was mesmerized by the process—how was Dracula able to elicit so many victories from a small army against the most fearsome enemy in all of Eurasia? Seemingly guessing my question, our host answered, \"We were all patriots, fighting for our freedom under a charismatic leader.”"
DRACULA4_INTRO_5 "\"Dracula had a thirst for blood unlike any other, but he was fair. His sense of justice, his romantic yet realistic morals—they wrought a change in all of us. Under his command, we were legion! And so we used our knowledge of the land, tactics of deception, and above all our ingenuity. Dracula taught us to use our strengths to our advantage, and that terror, speed, organization, and surprise were weapons more potent than our blades…”"
DRACULA5_INTRO_1 "His distraction past, the ancient warrior resumed his tale. \"Those twelve years were the longest of my life. I was alone, watching the countryside from this castle for signs of Dracula’s return, but all I saw was time after time where Turk marauders ravaged the countryside of this once beautiful land and tormented the people. By and by I heard word of Dracula’s imprisonment in Hungary, and I almost lost hope.”"
DRACULA5_INTRO_2 "\"One thing kept me vigilant and stopped me from falling into despair. It was the last words I had heard from my lord, when he told me that he would return, no matter if he had to travel to the depths of darkness and back. I repeated these words to myself every day, and promised myself that he would succeed—that my lord would return. It was a fool’s hope, but it was the best that I had—or that anybody had for that matter.”"
DRACULA5_INTRO_3 "\"Solitary and forlorn, I endured. In scores of hidden rooms and passages, Dracula had preserved enough food and water to last an entire army several years, no less one man. It was fortunate that you came, for just now were the provisions beginning to run out!” he exclaimed. I was curious though. \"Tell me of Dracula’s return! I am sure that it put you in a far better mood than you were!”"
DRACULA5_INTRO_4 "\"Indeed,” he answered. \"I had thought that he would never return, but my sporadic forays into the local countryside told me differently. Whispers at first, only rumors that I deigned to believe for fear of having my hopes dashed. But when I started hearing the same as I spied on Turk patrols, I was never surer of their truth. However, I shuddered at the sight of the land he would return to—he would not be pleased at all,” he laughed."
DRACULA5_INTRO_5 "\"Finally the day came. I awoke to the thundering of hooves and the energetic war cries of heartened soldiers pouring down from the Carpathians. Whatever miracle had occurred, I do not know, but it seemed that Dracula was at the head of Hungarian troops, come to liberate us at last from the yoke of the Turks and their puppet Basarab Laiota…”"
BARI1_INTRO_1 "I rushed back from the walls, my armor drenched in blood and sweat. The Normans were quite tenacious, and many soldiers were killed on the wall each day. After the battles, I usually went to an inn with my comrades to drink off the horrors of each day—but not today. My father, the heroic Michael Nautikos, savior of Bari and slayer of rebels, was waiting for me."
BARI1_INTRO_2 "Bursting through the door to my father's house, I found the wizened old man sitting at the great table, looking out the window. \"Foul, treacherous mercenary scum!\" he muttered while observing some enemy soldiers loading a trebuchet. \"Son, the inhabitants of this peninsula have been letting mercenaries in for almost 2,000 years. Not one bit of good it did them! When you win a battle with mercenaries, you switch one enemy for another.”"
BARI1_INTRO_3 "Weary of the Normans, I addressed my father: \"Father, I've spilled too much blood and seen far too much of these Normans for one day. Let us speak of more pleasant matters. Perhaps it would ease my mind if you could tell me the story of my great-grandfather?\" I asked. \"The old men still speak of him and tell stories, but I have heard so many that it is impossible to know the truth.\""
BARI1_INTRO_4 "Michael spun around, a gleam in his sunken eyes. The sun shone off his wispy, silver hair and for a minute, he looked like he was half his age. \"You want to hear the story of the family, son? Our family has pure Greek blood that runs back centuries! Nautikos, our surname—it is so because we came here as sailors. You look much like I did, many years ago…but very well, I will begin the tale,” ending his musings with a smile."
BARI1_INTRO_5 "\"In the year 869, your great-grandfather, the sailor and knight Panos Nautikos, answered the summons of his Byzantine liege, Emperor Basil II. They had entered into an alliance with the Carolingians, who wished our aid in defeating the infidel scum tainting Italy. Panos led a contingent of men who were to aid the army of Louis II, the Carolingian Emperor. And so one sunny morning, Panos strode to the harbor to board his ship...\""
BARI2_INTRO_1 "I walked downstairs the next morning, searching for my father. His health was far from adequate, and I worried that the wine he had drunk the night before might have made him ill. The battle of the night before was also fresh in my mind, and it chilled my blood. I whirled around, and found myself staring straight into my father's eyes. \"Son, are you alright?\" he asked."
BARI2_INTRO_2 "\"Yes,\" I lied, \"a late night and a bad dream, that's all. Father, could you tell me of the rebellion of Melus?\" I asked. \"You must have been a young man at the time, and your stories seem to take my mind away from the horrors surrounding us.\""
BARI2_INTRO_3 "Michael sat down by the window. The sun shone through onto his gaunt face, and although he was 82 years of age, he did not look it. Thick grey hair lay on the top of his head and his limbs were still supple from his many years as a sailor and a soldier. He began the story:"
BARI2_INTRO_4 "\"I have been a soldier of this city since the year 1005, when I was 16 years of age. Since our family has lived here for so long, I was able to serve under Lord Melus himself, the highest-ranking Lombard nobleman in the city. He needed somebody who knew the lay of the land and whose family was respected enough by all of the locals, and I was ambitious and eager to serve. I became his best man."
BARI2_INTRO_5 "Melus was always passionate but distant. He always was secretive and never showed me any praise, and was sometimes quite harsh and blunt. But I was loyal and happy to carry out his orders. When he summoned me to his castle one day, I assumed it was just another ordinary mission.\""
BARI3_INTRO_1 "Young men always wish to go to battle. They seek the romantic ideal of it, hoping to win renown and praise from their lord. They think that war is a noble affair, and that they can find glory on the battlefield. But my father, I, and any other soldier all know one thing for certain: The battlefield is the last place you will find it. There is nothing on the battlefield but the shouts of soldiers, the screams of dying men, and the stench of death."
BARI3_INTRO_2 "Courage is a fickle thing- it often accompanies men to the battlefield and leaves them there. Those who can hold onto their courage, when fear sets in- they are true heroes. But they are few. I long for peace. All of my life has been dominated by war, from the beginning of my training in the art of soldiery to the battles I fight here every day."
BARI3_INTRO_3 "I can hardly even remember the sound of music in the streets, the noises of a bustling city on market day, or even the din of merriment. Every day is the same- the sounds of battle, the whistling of rocks hurled from Norman trebuchets, and the solemn evening tales in the taverns told by men who had seen too few seasons but looked as if they had seen far too many."
BARI3_INTRO_4 "Michael walked towards me, a grave look in his eyes. He handed me his sword, a weapon passed down through our family, and his old helm, breastplate, faulds, and greaves. \"They are yours now—this is it,\" he said. \"Today, you must leave this place. Our family has been here for 200 years, it is true, and I am proud to have been able to tell my son our story. But you must think of your future too.\""
BARI3_INTRO_5 "\"Someday, you will tell your son this story with the same pride. Fight well today, escape, and secure yourself that future.\" I looked out the window, and noticed a strange sight- our soldiers walked the streets in the garb of the Tagmata. Then I saw the Varangians, and that could mean only one thing: allied ships had run the Norman blockade and delivered a few reinforcements. \"If they could do it, so can I,\" I thought as I walked out the door."
SFORZA1_INTRO_1 "A man who comes from nothing to become great. A boy in grief becomes a man. At that moment, though, I had more to think about than my position in life as the Alpine winds bite my skin. I was a mercenary once and now that I think about it, I was sorry at how far I'd fell. Penniless, I would have to beg to sit by a fire much less eat. But first I would have to find shelter. All other houses were dark, and there were no inns. I saw a few candles lit through the windows of a grand building in the distance."
SFORZA1_INTRO_2 "So I ran. I'm not as fast as those Scots and we people of Italia don't seem to believe in having squires carry our belongings for us. I was a Condottiero but I gave up my armor and horse to run on foot. Heh. I ran into the building in search of warmth. To my surprise, the doors creaked open. A massive library! It was warm, too, someone had taken great care to stay warm and I would have used the books as tinder. Ah! Am I not a man of the contract? We pride ourselves on being learned men, the successors of the Legions."
SFORZA1_INTRO_3 "A young man approached me. ‘Hello stranger. Welcome to the University of Florence! Or its libary, anyway. You can stay a while. What do you do?’ I laughed. ‘I WAS a Condottiero. Now I am old man who wears chainmail.’ The man smiled and told me he was reading about Dukes and Princes. He asked me if I knew of any.I said yes and I began ‘Once there was a young man who fought under his father who thought himself worldly and hardened - but in actuality was sheltered and not expecting to be thrust into the world of grief - but then again, no one ever does.."
SFORZA2_INTRO_1 "My new friend was quite curious to learn of the motivations behind Sforza's deeds, as well as what the man learned in his journeys. I was appreciative of his curiosity because the more questions he asked, the more food he brought me! ‘So Sforza learned politicking from an early age by dealing with his rebellious Captains.’ he stated quite thoughtfully."
SFORZA2_INTRO_2 "It was true. Francesco was not a Lord, and he did not inherit his fathers' retainers. He also inherited a few of his father's contacts such as Queen Joan of Naples. He served many important people well and grew in fame. ‘This was the time of the Lombardy Wars. The Florentines, Milanese, and Venetians were reaching a boiling point and scrambling to hire out Condottieri such as Sforza. Duke Visconti of Milan hired Sforza, as well as Malatesta. The Venetians hired Sforza's old rival Carmagnola.’"
SFORZA2_INTRO_3 "Duke Visconti was an ugly man, both in face and character. He was always paranoid and shied away from dealing with people, but had a cruel streak and enjoyed punishing others. Carmagnola once worked for visconti. The Duke disrespected him at every turn. He used to call us ‘contract dogs’! But when Carmagnola acted like a dog and left to join the Venetians for more money, Visconti was furious. He called a man with no loyalties to begin with a traitor. This meant he was more desperate to retain help and thus Sforza Brigata had greater opportunity for glory....and gold."
SFORZA3_INTRO_1 "‘Visconti freed Sforza after languishing in the dark. Much like you freed me from sleeping hungry outside on the dirt in the cold’ I could not thank the half-noble man enough. I figured he was somewhat rich. Who else would bring spare salted pork with them to a library? In addition, he must have had quite the upbringing as intelligent as he was. I still enjoy reading about military tactics but I never liked reading about Dukes and nobles; only a truly wise man could have the patience for that boring stuff."
SFORZA3_INTRO_2 "‘The Duke sounds like he was generous enough at times to gain the love of his people, but really it seems like they were used to a monarchy and wanted his line to continue. He was cruel but he still continued to reign.’ Indeed the Duke could go from paranoid, imprisoning a man as great as Sforza to generous in an instant, offering Sforza the hand of his daughter and thus inheritance of Milan. An issue tormenting Duke Visconti was his line, and he only had his illegitimate child Bianca Maria. Bianca's mother was the only woman Visconti ever loved and he had no other children with his wives."
SFORZA3_INTRO_3 "He had no son but given how often noble sons and fathers seem to quarrel, Sforza ironically became the closest thing to Visconti's son, as well as the closest thing to a Prince for the Milanese, who adored him and his gallant and generous army. Sforza would only get the hand of Bianca Maria if he could avenge Milan's loss to the Florentine-Venetian alliance. The Venetians were going to invade Milan once more and again hired Carmagnola, both for his skill and as an insult to Visconti. It was time for Sforza to redeem himself."
SFORZA4_INTRO_1 "Visconti died in 1447. This should have meant that Sforza would become Duke but matters were greatly complicated when Visconti's' relatives all lay claim to the riches of Lombardy. Alfonso V of Aragon, Charles of Orleans, Frederick III Holy Roman Emperor, the Hapsburgs... ‘And of course the people did not want a foreign man to rule over them.’ said my scholar-noble, and I nodded yes."
SFORZA4_INTRO_2 "The scholars and professors of Milan convinced the people to revert Milan back to a Republic. Sforza was immensely popular, and the Republicans gained further support by asking Sforza to become Captain General and reconquer the surrounding towns who decided to quietly rebel after Visconti's death. The young man asked ‘Sforza did not wish to force himself over the will of the people and so he must have been content in his new role?’"
SFORZA4_INTRO_3 "‘Ha ha!’ I laughed. ‘Content? Sforza might have led an easier life as Captain General than as Duke! They were paying him, and the rest of us, exceedingly well. But yes, if he tried to force himself to be the new Duke the people would rise up against him, anyway. Is it better to be loved or feared?’ This struck a chord with my friend, and he began to attack the parchment. I continued ‘Many cities were breaking away and it was up to the new Captain General of the Golden Ambrosian Republic to reign them in!’"
SFORZA5_INTRO_1 "The Republicans hated Sforza, the Milanese loved Sforza, Sforza joined with the Venetians to conquer Milan, the Milanese hated Venice, the Republicans were willing to make deals with Venice. The young man and I were plunged into the intricate world of Condottieri and Dukes and Republics and new Principalities. ‘So what did Sforza do? His life always has downs but he finds a way up.’ the youth said. "
SFORZA5_INTRO_2 "Sforza had started life as a bastard son of a contract hound. He lost his father and had to grow up quickly to take control of his Brigata. Brigata Sforza was a shining star among the mercenary companies, but he was quickly tossed into jail for a single mishap. He had redeemed himself and gained the hand of the daughter of a Duke but was still an unclear heir. After conquering the Duchy for the new heirs, the Golden Ambrosian Republic, he was cast out without a town to call his own."
SFORZA5_INTRO_3 "‘Indeed, a good observation. Sforza went to the Venetians for support and decided it was time to conquer Milan for himself. The Milanese did not blame Sforza and instead grew in their hatred of the Republicans.’ These scholars and professors had made a grave mistake. Sforza began to take city after city with the dubious help of the Venetians. When he marched on Milan itself, the people would not view him as a conqueror but as a liberator."
ELDORADO1_INTRO_1 "A city of gold is said to be somewhere in the New World but it is a distant memory now. I looked upon that accursed land with greed, and I lost my eye for it. Our leader is also missing an eye, but he lost it long ago. I am on the brigantine, San Pedro, and I can hear him shouting orders from La Victoria to our side. Francisco de Orellana wears a black eye patch on his face, matched by his black hair, black beard, and high cheekbones. In spite of that, there was many a time he saved us with a precise musket shot during our maddening and catastrophic adventure."
ELDORADO1_INTRO_2 "We followed him upon this massive river and through a vast jungle. And we will follow him out. We are on the Altantico now. I did not like ocean travel before, but the smell of salt water is a welcome feeling after smelling only sweat and humidity for almost two years. The men sense a storm coming. Don Orellana has asked me to keep a copy of my journal. I do not know why but it will be a good diversion as we set sail for many weeks. But I cannot continue with the rain waters pounding on my paper, sweeping away everything I write. So I will go below deck and start at the beginning."
ELDORADO1_INTRO_3 "January 1541 - I have decided to join an expedition to the East as a chaplain. The natives claim there exists a Land of Cinnamon. Governor Francisco Pizarro, the man who conquered the Inca, calls it Pais de la Canela. His brother Gonzalo will lead the force, and their nephew Francisco de Orellana, Governor of La Culata, is the one who recruited me. Men are eager to join but they do not talk of cinnamon. They talk of a king who covers himself in gold to show the wealth of his kingdom. And of course, his palace must be gold, his very capital must be made of gold. They say it is called... El Dorado."
ELDORADO2_INTRO_1 "April 1541 - Our men raided a small village today on the foothills of the mountains. Don Orellana came back to camp with a captive, a man named Delicola. Delicola could communicate with our Inca charges and is willing to take us into the depths of this land. He confirms our stories that there is indeed a Pais de la Canela. When asked about the City of Gold, he tells us the land of Cinnamon is a province that fuels the riches of El Dorado. He tells us enthusiastically of these territories... almost too enthusiastically."
ELDORADO2_INTRO_2 "June 1541 - This forest is unimaginably large, and I suspect it is bigger than Espana and New Castille combined. It is easily navigable, however. The lands of the Incas were not suited towards horses yet. Here, it is as though the trees have cleared a path for us. We have heard a few tales of Alejo Garcia, a Portuguese explorer whose expedition disappeared approaching this jungle from the east. A few of our allied Inca generals told us about an attack on their southern lands, led by a man similar to us. This man may have been Alejo Garcia. Delicola claims Garcia is still alive, or perhaps his son."
ELDORADO2_INTRO_3 "September 1541 - We are forced to rely more and more on native allies for help. The ones we encounter show great skill in woodworking, building large palisades quite easily. It is clear now that some of the massive trees reaching out from the forest are actually watchtowers, and I can see massive hills in the distance with smoke and fire coming from them. The trees must have been cleared by them to form roads. We may find this empire of gold after all."
ELDORADO3_INTRO_1 "December 1541 - It is hot and humid. It has also been weeks since we last heard from Gonzalo Pizarro. We elected Orellana to be the leader of this expedition. He in turn says our first priority is survival. What good is gold and glory in the face of our Lord? The men must live. The people of the Imara say that a massive sea is at the mouth of the river. Orellana believes this to be the Atlantico, and he has ordered the construction of a second brigantine that will allow us to divide the men and carry enough supplies to sail south, around this continent, and back north towards New Castille."
ELDORADO3_INTRO_2 "February 1542 - Today I held the hand of another one of my comrades as he met with our creator. Yet the men die of poisoned arrows and fever but not starvation. Our plan has worked successfully. We sail some distance, then stop and search, and repeat. So far the Indians have gladly traded with us. Eventually the villages turned to towns, with large temples of wood upon massive hills made of dirt and stone. One of the kings, who called himself Aparria, welcomed us to his capital, though it was not El Dorado. It was there that we built our second brigantine, El Victoria."
ELDORADO3_INTRO_3 "May 1542 - King Aparria warned us it would be much harder once we left his kingdom. His orderly roads and outposts turn to massive wetlands and marshes that melt into the great river. We were also told about the supreme peoples here: their men and women fight together in battle. I told Don Orellana about this today and he smirked, recalling the Greek tales of the Amazon warrior women. We see monuments far inland, and the men are tortured by the idea one of them could be a palace covered in gold. One huge structure looms ahead in the distance, seemingly in the middle of the river... could it be our fabled city?"
ELDORADO4_INTRO_1 "July 1542 - We have nearly made it out of this nightmare. The Amazones are gone but now we have another problem to deal with. Orellana came back from a raid and captured a little girl. She told us about the Negros who eat people. The Amazones wanted our blood but the Negros will want to eat our flesh. The men are quite disturbed by this. It is one thing to die in war at the hands of a man; it is quite another to be eaten by savages!"
ELDORADO4_INTRO_2 "We have heard yet another story from the locals: a group of 'Blancos' were captured by the Negros. These Blancos clasp their hands together to pray. They had muskets, horses, steel armor, and a large ship that is now destroyed. They must be Spaniards, or even Portuguese. Even more fortuitous, they must be soldiers and conquistadors like us with knowledge of shipbuilding. Furthermore, the Ocean must be nearby. If we can rescue our fellow Christians, we can make our brigantines seaworthy and fight off any hungry cannibals."
ELDORADO4_INTRO_3 "August 1542 - I have noticed that many of the Indians are beginning to fall ill, and we have seen them burying their dead just like we have for the past year. Surprise attacks have declined as well. But the Negros will be another story entirely. Orellana has ordered us to stop at an island, gather provisions, rescue the prisoners, and then prepare our ships. We may yet leave this accursed forest!"
INDIA1_INTRO_1 "My name is Chand Barhai, court poet of the Chauhan Dynasty. This is a chronicle of the greatest King of Punjab, Prithviraj Chauhan, and his love Sanyogita of the Gaharwar Dynasty. I want to ensure that people will remember the story of my friend. Prithviraj and I were both born in the same year. I believe destiny chose me to be the one to chronicle his story. I will make sure this tale will be passed down through the ages."
INDIA1_INTRO_2 "Prithviraj's courage came from his love. All people are born with the ability to love though they must learn it at first. The hatred in some men's hearts overwhelms their love and they become fearful. When we were children, we knew no fear. We were so carefree. I was a child poet assigned to a child Prince and I would accompany him on his adventures. How else was I to write about the life of Prithviraj Chauhan?"
INDIA1_INTRO_3 "Even in those days Prithviraj was a courageous Prince, always fighting in battles for his father. The people loved him, and he took great care to help the commoners. He would always ask me to exaggerate his feats but he was indeed noble. There was one particular adventure, a hunting trip, that turned into a battle against the Solanki King, Bhimdev. Listen well my friends to my chronicle, to the Prithviraj Raso!"
INDIA2_INTRO_1 "Prithviraj ascended the throne at the age of twenty. Our peaceful lives turned to the building of the Kingdom. Prithviraj brought Ajmer under direct rule, and it became a twin city of Delhi. I continued to compose my poetry and chronicle his feats but I also took on the role of an advisor and an ambassador. I would sometimes rule the kingdom while Prithviraj went and saw his lover Sanyogita in secret."
INDIA2_INTRO_2 "In the days before the Ghorids, the Land of Five Rivers was divided by many different Rajas. Sanyogita's father, Jaichand of the Gaharwars ruled one of the most powerful Rajput clans. Another powerful clan was the Solankis ruled by Prithviraj's old rival Bhimdev. Meanwhile the fading Ghaznavids continued their raids into the Punjab after being driven there by the men we now call the Ghorids. Let me demonstrate the power of love."
INDIA2_INTRO_3 "Amidst the turmoil, death, and battles, Prithviraj never forgot his Sanyogita. They would often meet in border towns. There would be occasions in which my Raj would be fresh from a victory then trot his horse to an enemy town to meet his lover. Some other times would he sleep in the arms of the beautiful young Princess and then wake the next morning to march with his men. It was a time of great turbulence and I will relate to you what kind of storms love had to survive..."
INDIA3_INTRO_1 "Jaichand was still a formidable foe, even if he was forced to recognize Prithviraj as the strongest Raj. He found out about Sanyogita's meetings with Prithviraj and promptly locked her up in his palace. To make matters worse, he invited the other Princes and Kings of the land to meet his daughter in a ceremony known as the Svayamvara so that she may choose to marry one of them. All of course, except for my own King."
INDIA3_INTRO_2 "Well...Prithviraj was in attendance at the Svayamvara, at least a clay statue of him. Jaichand asked for the statue to be made and I heard that he laughed when he placed his clay Prithviraj near the front of the palace. What happened next was astonishing: when time came for Sanyogita to choose her husband, she walked past all of the suitors and placed a wreath of garlands over the statue!"
INDIA3_INTRO_3 "The headstrong Princess allowed Prithviraj enough time to muster a small army and sneak into Jaichand's capital of Kannauj. Of all the plans that a King could make, sneaking into his enemy's city to steal a woman! Love is a funny thing and can cloud the judgment of even the most capable monarchs. The worst part? I did not feel for a second that my Raj would fail in his scheme which, given the turn of events, may have been poor judgment on my part. Love clouds all!"
INDIA4_INTRO_1 "Prithviraj had managed to unify most of the Punjab and the surrounding lands just in time to face his equal in combat. A final showdown was coming. Muhammad Ghori was considered to be a conquering hero among the Muslims, while Prithviraj was a chivalrous and dashing champion. Sanyogita's father conspired with Muhammad against my Raj, not realizing that if Prithviraj were to die, Sanyogita would gladly die with him."
INDIA4_INTRO_2 "I accompanied my Raj to the battle site. The village of Tarain was nearby. He asked me to stay next to his brother, Govind Thai, for the bulk of the battle. I did not want to leave him but he had a sense of foreboding about the upcoming battle. The Ghorids held the city of Bathinda, and had a well-fortified camp with their most elite troops to the north."
INDIA4_INTRO_3 "Massive battle lines of over one hundred thousand men each. This would be cataclysmic. Two virtual equals, two kings of kings would bring the strongest men of all regions of the Punjab and Persia to bear in one encounter. Could either man live while the other breathes? Would Prithviraj be able to see his beloved Sanyogita? Would love prevail one more time?"

ALARIC1_OUTRO_1 "Our soldiers returned to a triumphant fanfare. They brought back carts laden with gold, jewelry, expensive spices, and other valuable treasures. More importantly, they brought back a promise: the Roman senate had agreed to persuade Emperor Honorius to grant us our long-awaited land. But not all faces were cheerful. Many sons did not return. Many wives stood vigil throughout the night, praying their husbands had only fallen behind. Some waited for days, each gloomier than the last, stoically watching, silently mourning."
ALARIC1_OUTRO_2 "Whispers spread in the dark corners of the camp. Some soldiers still desired the plunder of Rome itself, convinced that the wealth in their wagons was a pittance compared with the treasures remaining in Roman coffers. They whispered of Roman duplicity, and wondered if their King truly believed the Senate would uphold their desperate bargain. Was Alaric cowardly, to shy away from taking Rome? Did the Senate buy him with their carts of gold? Was he merely a Roman puppet?"
ALARIC2_OUTRO_1 "The sun had set and shadows danced against the tents before Alaric came home. I cried out. He was soaked in blood! He walked like the God of Death sent to claim the slain. And those eyes... as empty as in my dreams. With all the courage I had, I touched him. The sword fell to the floor, and he collapsed onto a stool.\n\n\"Six thousand.” He uttered in disbelief. \"Six thousand Romans. All dead.” His face contorted into a snarl. \"Honorius.” He whispered. Our dreams were shattered that day by the treachery of the Emperor. Our hope of a new home washed away by a red flood. Yet Alaric did not lose faith. He could not lose faith."
ALARIC3_OUTRO_1 "After so long in the high ceilings and broad halls of Rome, the low tents to which I returned were comforting, more homely. Kinsmen approached me with hope in their eyes, still allied with my husband, heart and soul. I shared no such enthusiasm. \"Yet he is seeing the Emperor himself!” They said. \"Surely he must make progress now.”"
ALARIC3_OUTRO_2 "They cheered when he returned. I knew better. He and his men slumped over their horses, heads bowed, faces chiseled, as if daring the earth to test them again. The shouts faded when my people noticed the blood on their tunics. That night I mourned the loss of a trusting man. Gone were the days when a man was bound by honor. A new age of treachery and war peeked over the horizon. A hard age. A cold age. \n\nA dark age."
ALARIC4_OUTRO_1 "\"Spare the churches.” He ordered coldly. \"Don't burn the churches.” Some say the gates had been opened to Alaric by the Romans themselves, hoping for his leniency. Others say that slaves had done the work, most of them captives taken by the late Stilicho in his wars. Much of the Roman garrison fled their posts, knowing survival against the army was unlikely. Rampant soldiers ransacked many great buildings, and they scattered the ashes of Augustus and Hadrian from their tombs."
ALARIC4_OUTRO_2 "My husband died a bitter man, with plans to drive the Romans out of Italy. He prepared ships to chase them even to Egypt, and was only halted by divine intervention. Satisfied at last, God deemed the punishment of Rome fit enough, and destroyed Alaric's ships in a storm before they could be loaded. Around the same time my husband exhaled his last, tired breath."
ALARIC4_OUTRO_3 "Athaulf ascended the throne as his successor. He married Honorius's sister in order to secure peace with Rome once and for all. He brought us north, beyond the ravaged lands of Italy, and into Gaul. And there, at long last, we finally settled. Free from plots and treachery, free from invasion, and free from Rome."
ALARIC4_OUTRO_4 "I say a small prayer for Alaric every morning. I hope he has watched our people prosper in the years since his last triumph. I pray he has found peace since \"seeking at the last to found the city, and bring o'er his fathers' gods to safe abode in Latium,” as Virgilius wrote.\n\nWe have found our Latium, my love."
DRACULA1_OUTRO_1 "As we watched our meal cook, I stepped forth, addressing our host: \"We found this on the trail leading up the mountain,\" I said, holding out the sword and scabbard. \"I have never seen its like before. Perhaps you know something about it?\" The host smiled. \"The Order of the Dragon,\" he said at once. \"What you have just brought me is the lost blade of Vlad Dracula himself!\""
DRACULA1_OUTRO_2 "I was shocked. \"The sword of Vlad Dracula! How did it come to be lost?\" Our host smiled. His eyes flashed, and when he looked up, there was a strained look on his face. At one moment he looked like he had seen far too many seasons, and the next he appeared young and lively. Finally, the rush of memories seemed to slow and become more controlled. \"That is a long story…but then again, we have a long time until dawn.\""
DRACULA1_OUTRO_3 "The old man sighed and continued his tale. \"Dracula sought refuge at the Moldavian court. There, he learned that Vladislav II had cunningly begun to mediate peace talks between the Ottomans and Hungarians, temporarily securing his position as Voivod. Furious, Dracula vowed to never deal with the Turks again, and swore vengeance on Ottomans, Wallachian Boyars, and Danesti clansmen alike.\""
DRACULA2_OUTRO_1 "The emaciated old man gave a thin smile. \"One's tenacity of mind can compensate for other disadvantages,\" he remarked in a pensive voice. \"It was a glorious victory! Dracula slaughtered untold numbers of enemy troops and Danesti clansmen. The large circle of impaled men that soon formed outside Targoviste awed merchants and travelers for weeks to come, and Dracula's army feasted for an entire week to celebrate the victory.”"
DRACULA2_OUTRO_2 "\"Wallachia was back in the hands of the Draculesti clan, but it was not the Wallachia his father ruled. The land was barren from endless wars, and when Dracula entered Targoviste, he saw a city rife with corruption, crime, and poverty,\" the old man growled. \"It was a great triumph,\" I remarked, \"but it seems there was much work to do! How did he so quickly turn a ruined shell of a country into a force to be reckoned with?\""
DRACULA2_OUTRO_3 "The ancient man grinned, and the light flashed across his eyes again, as he seemed to remember a fond memory of past days. \"Dracula despised dishonesty and crime, and wanted to eliminate it not just for personal reasons, but because he knew that Wallachia must remain strong in the face of its enemies—to stand up to the might of the Turks—and soon. And so his reforms began.\""
DRACULA3_OUTRO_1 "This man, whomever he was, was certainly no commoner, and had quite an arsenal of knowledge. I wondered if perhaps he had fought in the wars, so long ago. Our host had risen again to leave the room, and returned minutes later, a grandiose tome in hand. He opened it and began reading to himself. Soon, I spoke again. \"You know much of Dracula's quest for power. Did you fight under him then?\""
DRACULA3_OUTRO_2 "My question was answered with a grin and a nod. \"Where else did you fight?\" I asked. \"There were so many battles during that time, it is said that every man in the kingdom marched on one campaign or another. It's a miracle that we have the peace that we have now!\" At my mention of the word \"peace\", our host whirled around to face me, glaring."
DRACULA3_OUTRO_3 "\"Giurgiu. Darstor, Novoselo, and Dridopoyrom. And many more,\" he said while revealing the scars on his arms. \"Our strikes were quicker and more elusive than bolts of lightning. The strange thing, though, is your mention of peace. Yes, we have peace now, but I have never had peace here,\" he told us, gesturing to his head. \"Not a single day goes by when I do not think about it.\""
DRACULA4_OUTRO_1 "\"Unfortunately, my friends, this was where my lord and I were separated,” the gaunt old man continued. \"As the Turks entered the castle courtyard at Poenari, murder was on their minds. With unbridled rage and lust for loot, they ransacked the once-great fortress that we had fought so hard to defend, slaying all in their path. Taking refuge in one of the secret ways that Dracula had built, I watched his coracle sail down the mountain stream.”"
DRACULA4_OUTRO_2 "\"The Turks put the castle to the torch, but its stone bastions never caught flame, and so I was spared.” Breaking out once again into a sad laughter, our host continued, \"Almost as if God was with us, the footsteps of the Turk army started a punishing avalanche that blocked the route to the castle and felled scores of their Janissaries.” Although this \"evidence” of divine retribution excited him, I figured it was due to the enemy cannon."
DRACULA4_OUTRO_3 "I was not eased by the change in the mood of our host. Furthermore, it was past the witching hour and my men and I had not seen sleep in more than two days. Howls of wolves and the screeches of bats filled the air as we quietly ate, enjoying our fifth meal of the night but also not knowing what else to do. It seemed that the old man was lost in ruminations of times long gone by. For now, I conversed with my comrades."
DRACULA5_OUTRO_1 "\"Dracula achieved his victory at last, and drove the invaders fleeing before him. Gathering his men for a final battle against the Turks, he charged the enemy ranks with an unspeakable vengeance that emanated from his figure and emboldened his army. Total and utter victory was near, but it was that hour when Dracula’s luck ran out,” our host said with a sigh."
DRACULA5_OUTRO_2 "\"A stray arrow flew through the air, and as if it had eyes, found its target and pierced Dracula through his courageous heart. Leaderless, our forces were routed and our chance to drive out the Turks was lost. Despair set in as things returned to the way they were, and the unlucky ones who remained saw hope vanish,” the old man concluded emptily. But I thought that perhaps there was something I could do for the vicarious patriarch."
DRACULA5_OUTRO_3 "\"Your faithful retelling assures that the memory of your lord will find eternity,” I said kindly. \"Perhaps there is something I can do for you in return. The road down from the castle is now clear—would you join us on our journey? We mean to visit the monastery at Snagov to pay our respects to Dracula’s grave.” The elderly man nodded in reply. \"Before we set off, might I ask your name?” I added. \"Istvan,” he said with a smile."
BARI1_OUTRO_1 "\"And so our kin broke the Lombard defenses and subjected the city to a glorious sack!\" Michael exclaimed. \"After the rebuilding, Panos was offered lordship of the city, but he turned it down. He just wanted to live out his days in peace, much like us all. Luckily for him, he did. He settled down, and my father--your grandfather was born several years later. Panos did what any good man would want to do- bring glory to his house.\""
BARI1_OUTRO_2 "\"But what of Louis?\" I asked. The old man mused for a long time. The wine had clearly stalled his thought, but finally he seemed to recall. \"Ah, Louis. He never came back,\" laughed Michael. \"The Lombards said that he would lose his feet were he to tread on their land again. At least that's what he apparently said. More likely, he just had to deal with barbarians in the north. He died soon after.\""
BARI1_OUTRO_3 "Suddenly, a bell rang, followed by the cries of battle. The Normans were attempting to scale the wall in the dark of night, but a watchman had seen them approaching. I donned my armor and rushed out the door. Michael sighed and must have remembered his heyday, when he heroically donned armor and cut down foes with his longsword. Now I, his son, was doing the same, and it made him proud."
BARI2_OUTRO_1 "Michael stood up, walked over to the fireplace, and added more wood, stoking the fire with a poker. \"1011. It had been 2 years since I had stood in the courtyard of Melus' castle in Bari. After the siege, the rebel army was defeated and Bari was repossessed by the Empire. The new Catapan of this land made me a captain in the army I helped him recruit from the countryside.\""
BARI2_OUTRO_2 "\"Father, what of Melus?\" I asked. \"You told me that when you entered the city and took his castle, he was gone!\" Michael coughed, a ghastly sound to hear. \"I neither saw nor heard from Melus again, but I know that he was slain soon after.\" He took another draught of wine. I then asked: \"Father, you said that Melus recruited barbarians to fight. Who? The Normans and Apulian Lombards fought with you!\""
BARI2_OUTRO_3 "\"Goths, Slavs, Germans, even Arab horsemen. Melus reached far for help, and some came even whom were not asked. But there was one more group whose help Melus enlisted,\" Michael added angrily. \"Who, father?\" I asked. \"A new generation of Norman adventurers, the fathers of the scum who attack our city as we speak,\" he answered. \"It is because of Melus that this new menace is upon us.\""
BARI3_OUTRO_1 "Now in the heart of the Byzantine Empire, my ship was not the only one to have sailed from Bari. One morning, I was speaking to the owner of a small butcher shop, when I heard shouts from down in the harbor. Racing down to the docks, I saw several men being carried from their battered vessel, a ship that had sailed from Bari just as the Norman armies entered the city. I asked for news of my father."
BARI3_OUTRO_2 "\"The folk always whispered of your father's fame as a soldier, but he looked ageless in all his glory,\" one told me. \"Just as he did all those years ago, he fought valiantly in the streets for his honor and his people, and died honorably.\" I turned to my own thoughts…I still have my family's weaponry and armor, but I doubt I will ever wear them again. I have seen enough battle for ten lifetimes, and I hope to try my hand at a different craft."
BARI3_OUTRO_3 "I think I shall travel the Empire from Thessaly to Anatolia, seeking work as I go. Perhaps I will earn enough money to buy myself and my future family a house in the countryside outside Patrae, and raise miles of vineyards on the hillside. And maybe one day, when I recount the tale of my family to my children and grandchildren, I will be able to conclude it with how we have found peace at last."
SFORZA1_OUTRO_1 "‘...and that is how Francesco Sforza went from boy to man.’ The young man followed my every word with a thoughtfulness in his eyes. He disappeared for a while, then brought some parchment and ink. Oh, and he also brought my two favorite things, salted pork and filone. ‘That can't be the end of Francesco Sforza's tale, could it?’ he bribed me with delicious food to write his book! I said no, that was not the end. Francesco Sforza's tale was far from over."
SFORZA2_OUTRO_1 "Visconti could be generous to his people and mercenaries who performed well for him. But the failure of his army and the destruction of his heavy cavalry enraged Visconti, as well as his pride in losing to Carmagnola. Malatesta had lost the day but in his paranoia he imprisoned Sforza, believing him to have purposely taken too long at defending Pavia to help in Pizzighettone. I made sure my friend took great note when I told him ‘Visconti sent one of the best Condottieri in Italy to rot in Milan's dungeons. He had risen to shine very great in his campaigns in Lombardy but he was again laid low.’"
SFORZA3_OUTRO_1 "The battle was a major victory for Milan, especially for Sforza. After the battle Sforza rebuilt aqueducts, farms, and houses destroyed by his or Carmagnola's armies. Carmagnola was beheaded in the San Marco forum for his failure. My savior asked ‘Was Sforza generous to the Milanese in order to gain their love so he could oust Visconti and become Duke?’ I told him ‘I don't think so. Remember, the people still loved Visconti.  Francesco was self-serving like most Condotteri but had he killed Visconti, he would rule over a population that hated him. Francesco would eventually get his chance anyway.’"
SFORZA4_OUTRO_1 "‘I don't understand why the Republicans thought making Sforza into their enemy was a good idea. They promised Brescia to him, but they made peace with the city behind his back in the middle of his siege. Brescia stayed independent, Sforza had nothing.’ I shrugged. The scholar said ‘If Sforza was more feared, they wouldn't have dared to betray him. The Republicans must have thought he was weak.’ Sforza had Bianca, the heir to the Dukedom but he didn't pursue it; maybe they saw it as a sign of weakness. I reminded my friend that Sforza was beloved in Milan and this would later work to his advantage."
SFORZA5_OUTRO_1 "Sforza was actually invited into the city by the starving people of Milan, and practically elected Duke with Bianca Maria as his Duchess. Sforza had not touched the Milanese countryside and quickly rebuilt any accidentally destroyed Farms. He immediately imprisoned the Republicans but astonishingly he eventually granted them amnesty. This mercenary who seemed to only love gold wrote the Peace of Lodi with Milan's old enemy, Florence. ‘So that is how a private person becomes a public man.’ I replied ‘Yes. A bastard contract hound becomes the most powerful Duke in Italy. So my friend what are you writing? And what is your name?’ He replied ‘I am making a book for Princes on how to rule their kingdoms. And my name is Nicolo Machiavelli.’"
ELDORADO1_OUTRO_1 "March 1541 - It has been one month since we left La Culata. Many of our men have commended their spirits to the lord, others have run back to Quito. I do not blame them. At least we were heartened by meeting with Pizarro's main force last night. Even among the leaders of our expedition, the tales of cinnamon are beginning to give way to the tales of gold. Orellana spoke of the deserters and the dead: 'You men who are left, you have the strongest will. Hernan Cortes conquered the Mexica. Francisco Pizarro conquered the Inca. We will conquer El Dorado!' We rested in the Valley of Sumaco, the farthest east any of us had been. In fact Orellana is the only man on the expedition familiar with Sumaco. When I looked towards the east at sunrise, I saw an unending sea of green."
ELDORADO2_OUTRO_1 "November 1541 - I had suspected Delicola of mischief, and unfortunately I was right. He abandoned us a few nights ago, yelling something about besting Pizarro and saving his people from destruction. He must have heard of the conquest of the Inca and thought Gonzalo to be Francisco. Speaking of Gonzalo, we have been separated from him by the river currents. So here we are, stranded with many sick and dying men on our two ships on this sweltering and grand river with jungle on either side of us. I pray the Lord have mercy upon us and deliver us... maybe I should pray that the Lord inspire Don Orellana."
ELDORADO3_OUTRO_1 "June 1542 - The stories were true, and we fought the terrifying women warriors in the shadow of their huge temple. It easily rivaled Coricancha in New Castille. A stray sling stone smashed my face. The Lord took my eye, but he gave us hope as we leave Amazonia. The Amazones were not the rulers of El Dorado, though. I should urge the men to stop thinking of cities of gold or cinnamon, and instead ask them to think of cities of food paved with tortas, with walls of jamon, and rivers of gazpacho. The only way to Ciudad de Alimento now is through the Atlantic."
ELDORADO4_OUTRO_1 "It feels like Don Orellana has been shouting orders for three weeks straight. My journal is finished but he is telling the men he is not. Once we return to La Culata, he will search for El Dorado again. He must have asked me to copy my journal to use for future exploration. One copy for him, and one for myself. I want others to read about Orellana and credit him for finding such a strange and dangerous land. He was the first man to explore that massive river, and circle around the southern part of the New World from ocean to ocean. I can only hope his legend will exceed the legends of the fool's gold of El Dorado. I will make sure of it."
INDIA1_OUTRO_1 "Even with Bhimdev's soldiers hammering at the gates of the Temple, \"Nandini\" and \"Prithnanni\" were calmed when they looked into each other's eyes. Love at first sight. We came to learn that Nandini was actually the princess Sanyogita of Kannauj, daughter of Raja Jaichand. Jaichand and Sanyogita's clan, the Gaharwars, hated the Chauhans. It was as if though the two were not meant to be, yet love finds a way."
INDIA2_OUTRO_1 "Prithviraj became the most powerful ruler east of the River Sindh. He had bested Bhimdev, and made Jaichand into a jealous vassal. It is strange that another man was born in the same year as Prithviraj and myself, and that man was the feared Muhammad Ghori. We were all reborn at the same time for a purpose. He was a constant shadow upon our backs...an inevitability. Yet Prithviraj saw his marriage to Sanyogita as an inevitability, as well."
INDIA3_OUTRO_1 "Prithviraj had convinced himself that he could sneak into a heavily fortified city, steal his Princess, run through enemy territory, and then defeat the Princess's enraged father in combat. He convinced us all. That is how love works, and it spread throughout the twin cities of Delhi and Ajmer. Prithviraj and Sanyogita were destined for fall in love. However there was another destiny to be fulfilled. Muhammad Ghori was coming."
INDIA4_OUTRO_1 "Despite a valiant effort, my king was captured after the second battle of Tarain. Muhammad Ghori blinded Prithviraj and mockingly challenged him to an archery contest. I visited my king in prison and told him that he must hear the Sultan's voice and make his aim true. Before being put to death, Prithviraj shot an arrow through Muhammad's heart and slew him there. Both men died on the same day. Stricken with grief and defiant to the end, Sanyogita jumped into fires and slowly burned to death to defend the honor of her King. Love is powerful and causes people to do great things. Love never fades away."

BUKHARA_INTRO_1 "Seventy-three years have passed. Seventy-three long years since the horsemen of the White Huns trampled the former Eastern border of Persia like a swarm of locusts, ambushed our beloved Shah, and then plundered the heartland of the empire. Their advance was barely stopped with the help of the local nobility. Afterwards our weakened empire had no choice but to give in to the outrageous annual demands of tribute imposed by the White Huns. Now, seventy-three years later, Khosrau, the grandson of the slain Shah, is ready to take revenge for this eternal shame cast upon his family's name."
BUKHARA_INTRO_2 "His family is the renowned dynasty of the Sassanids, rulers of one the greatest empires that ever existed and having done so for several centuries now. In the meantime, on the western border, our other archenemy, the Byzantines, will have to wait until the threat of the East has been dealt with. An uneasy peace treaty with them has given us time to deal with the White Huns and so Khosrau has told his generals to go to all four corners of the empire and gather the support of every man and family in the empire."
BUKHARA_INTRO_3 "But even with an army that could fill the space between the Zagros and the Alborz mountains, Khosrau knows that the White Huns are a foe not to be underestimated. The only way to be sure of victory would be to ally with another enemy of theirs, the Gokturks. These nomads from lands hardly known to civilized men hate the White Huns just as much as we Persians do. The Gokturks live in harsh conditions and are trained to fight on horseback just as well as the White Huns and their arrows will not easily miss their targets."
BUKHARA_INTRO_4 "As I mount my heavy armored horse and hear the earth tremble under the weight of my fellow Savaran horsemen riding East to meet our Shah Khosrau, a pleasant but ominous thought comes to mind. Our Shah, Khosrau would soon show the world that the Persian empire is still a force to be reckoned with. He would show the White Huns that the Sassanids would not stand for the disgrace cast upon them and will wipe the White Huns off the face of the earth..."
CYPRUS_INTRO_1 "Who would not have heard the name of Richard I of England? Better known as the Lionheart, he remains an iconic figure in England and France. Despite being a legend, he really was a controversial person. Some say \"he was a bad son, a bad husband, and a bad king, but a gallant and splendid soldier.\" During his reign of ten years, he did not spend more than 6 months in England. He was not an Englishman either, he was French, a Plantagenet, and did not even speak English, but a dialect of French."
CYPRUS_INTRO_2 "He used his kingdom, England as a source of revenue to support his armies. Moreover, he had a rash personality that was frustrating at times, and therefore he often conflicted with his allies. But how did he manage to earn his fame and become a legend despite all this? His contemporaries saw him as a true hero, and this image remained until today. He was a brave individual warrior, a skilled military leader, and a righteous person. He poeticized and enjoyed playing chess."
CYPRUS_INTRO_3 "Exemplifying all of the knightly virtues, he was a true knight-king, the first of his kind. He established his repute by taking part in the Third Crusade. The Crusade was launched because in the year 1187, Saladin, the sultan of Egypt, conquered Jerusalem, the holy city of the three major religions. Richard allied with Frederick Barbarossa, Holy Roman Emperor and Philip Augustus, King of France to conduct a crusade against Saladin to reclaim Jerusalem for Christianity."
CYPRUS_INTRO_4 "Of the latter two, Barbarossa was known as the other most soldierly ruler in Europe at the time. When the campaign was launched, Barbarossa chose to travel to the Holy Land by land, while Richard and Philip traveled by sea. They met in Sicily, but the tension between the two rival kings was obvious. Richard's way through the Mediterranean Sea to the Holy Land was as adventurous as one would expect from someone called the Lionheart..."
DOSPILAS_INTRO_1 "There's an old tale told by our village elders here on the Yucatan peninsula. Although almost faded, it has managed to survive for so long and lives on through us as it's passed from one generation to another. Our hunters often return from their hunts and they describe massive stone manmade mountains and carved images of gods and strange people. It tells us that the tale is true..."
DOSPILAS_INTRO_2 "At night I join the others around the campfire and when our village elder starts telling the tale I can hear my own heartbeat racing. \"A long, long time ago, during the time of kings and gods\" he starts... From that moment I imagine myself as a character in the story. As if the story was my own..."
DOSPILAS_INTRO_3 "A long, long time ago, during the time of kings and gods, two great cities, Tikal and Calakmul, reigned over Yucatan. Tikal had engaged itself in a war with Calakmul, also known as the \"serpent kingdom\" after the great serpent god. In order to secure the jade and cacao trade, Tikal founded the city of Dos Pilas in the Petexbatùn region and the old king, K'inich Muwaan Jol II, sent his younger son, B'alaj Chan K'awiil, to rule it. The older son, Nuun Ujol Chaak, was to rule over Tikal itself."
DOSPILAS_INTRO_4 "B'alaj Chan K'awiil, however, was jealous of his older brother and wasn't pleased with the smaller city of Dos Pilas that he was given. Over time the war god, Buluc Chabtan, planted seeds of resentment and hate in him. He was convinced that he would be a better ruler of Tikal than his brother..."
HONFOGLALAS_INTRO_1 "\"Are you still working? Why do you work so much?\" the young Romanos asked his father, who was sitting in his dark workroom next to a candlelit table. Constantine smiled, and answered: \"The life of an emperor is very busy. The Byzantine empire is big and strong, but it does not function just by itself. Problems always occur that you have to solve in order to keep everything in order. You will see for yourself later.\""
HONFOGLALAS_INTRO_2 "\"Are you writing laws?\" asked Romanos, pointing at the large book lying in front of his father. \"No, I am compiling all of my knowledge and experience about governing the empire in a book for you and the next generations of emperors to come.\" \"That is interesting,\" Romanos observed. \"Can I have a look?\" Constantine smiled again. \"You should be in bed now, but after all, I am writing it for you. Come here... for an Empire as grandiose as ours, deft diplomacy is vital.\""
HONFOGLALAS_INTRO_3 "To make your empire survive and thrive you always have to know with whom to maintain peace, and whom to conquer. To make such decisions you have to know the surrounding peoples well and understand their culture and history. Right now I am writing about a very interesting group of people. They are called the Hungarians, but are also known as the Magyars."
HONFOGLALAS_INTRO_4 "They live in Central Europe, near the Danube River, yet their language and customs are utterly different from those of other Europeans. They are pagans, not Christians and have a very warlike nature. They are fierce warriors who fight from horseback and master the skill of archery. With their constant raids all over Europe they have caused many problems for the feudal rulers."
HONFOGLALAS_INTRO_5 "\"Why are they so different? Where did they come from?\" inquired Romanos. \"They came from as far as the Ural mountains in Asia. There you could still meet their relatives, who speak similar Ugric languages. Originally, they were a nomadic pastoral people, but climate change and the appearance of the aggressive Pechenegs forced them to migrate westward. After a long and arduous migration, they reached the Carpathian Basin...\""
KURIKARA_INTRO_1 "The wind whispers a faint melody as it glides through the mountain trees, while the footsteps of soldiers and the creaking of a rolling cart provide the fitting harmony. The pass has a forbidding aura to it, for it is so thin that only thirty men can walk abreast—a narrow corridor perfect for trapping a force in an ambush—and yet there is a peaceful feel to it that calms the nerves of the troops that form Minamoto's vanguard."
KURIKARA_INTRO_2 "Trudging through the pass, the common soldiers groan as a deluge is unleashed, turning the once-firm earth into a treacherous sea of mud. The samurai alone are silent, being battle-hardened veterans to whom the concept of pain is foreign. Their honor is their prime concern, and right now, it rests on the success of their mission: To deliver supplies to the besieged city of Kurikara, a bastion that guards a chokepoint vital to this war."
KURIKARA_INTRO_3 "After years of oppression and anger at the decadence of the Imperial Court, the Minamoto clan declared its open opposition to the dominance of the wicked Taira, splitting Japan into East and West. Lord Minamoto no Yoritomo holds the Minamoto heartland to the East, while his cousin Yoshinaka holds the frontier. Throughout two and a half years of war, the Taira have steadily advanced, rarely seeing defeat thus far."
KURIKARA_INTRO_4 "Their armies advance quickly in a three-pronged assault on Kurikara in an attempt to take the heavily defended pass that has slowed their progress East. In addition to erecting four massive siege camps, the Taira have captured the lighthouse at the point of the Noto Peninsula, controlling naval passage in and out of the Toyama Gulf. Entourages of samurai patrol all roads to Kurikara, and enemy supply lines reach all the way to Kyoto."
KURIKARA_INTRO_5 "This will be the decisive battle of this war. If Kurikara falls, there will be nothing to stop thousands of Taira samurai from flooding into the Minamoto heartland, assuring a swift victory. But if Kurikara holds and the grandiose Taira samurai troop is defeated, then the tide of the war will turn, and Yoritomo will be able to bring the fight to the gates of Kyoto and to the Imperial Palace itself."
LANGSHAN_INTRO_1 "10th century- the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in Medieval China. The land is once again in turmoil. In the far East, near the sea, there is the small coastal state of Wuyue, advanced in science and culture. Due to its wealth it has given its ruler Qian Liu the opportunity to attack Wuyue's bigger and stronger neighbor, the state of Wu. Wu is a military powerhouse and hated by the other states, so Qian Liu aims to destroy his enemy and secure its military power for himself."
LANGSHAN_INTRO_2 "Success will ensure eternal glory for the king and his people and a chance at reuniting China. Defeat will mean the end of the Wuyue state and its great ruler. The invasion is to take place near the Langshan or the Wolf Mountain, on the northern shores of the Yangtze river, where the Wuyue navy under prince Qian Yuanguan has quickly built a fleet of small war vessels, having modified fishing and trade ships. The Wu, however, got word of the river invasion and have sent their best commander, Peng Yanzhang, to protect the river at all costs."
LANGSHAN_INTRO_3 "Resources in this war-plagued land are scarce and technology and innovation will prove to play an important role in the upcoming battle. Outnumbered and in hostile territory, Qian Yuanguan will need to be creative and work quickly in order to succeed. Aside from technology, the prince will also have to rely on the support of the locals to obtain more supplies for his navy. Therefore, Qian Liu has ordered his son to sail down the river to a lake on whose shores he plans to build a grandiose temple."
LANGSHAN_INTRO_4 "If he succeeds in building it, the temple will show the people of Wu the might of the Wuyue and the ruler of Wu will quickly lose his support among his military leaders. While small rays of sun dance on the steady and calm Wolf Mountain River, shouts are heard in the far distance... If silent, one can hear them cry: \"Enemy ships sighted!\". Soon the river will turn red..."
SOGUT_INTRO_1 "Just as sun rises in the East, so did the hordes of Mongolia out of the steppes of the East. Their empire now stretched as far as Anatolia, where refugees of the fallen Eastern Turkish empires started occupying Byzantine land. Even the mighty Seljuk empire was gone and the Rum Sultanate and other minor kingdoms in Anatolia were the only kingdoms left in Turkish hands. At this moment, Osman, a young member of a Turkish tribe, became aware of the opportunity that lay ahead of him."
SOGUT_INTRO_2 "With many of the neighboring powers gone or busy fighting the Mongols while the Byzantine Empire in the West was slowly crumbling, he knew that he had to strike the iron while it was hot. Son of a Turkish Bey, he had followed his nomadic family to this new fertile place in former Roman lands. Now that he had grown up, he took his father's place and became a Bey himself. He was unmatched in physical strength and therefore got the name bone-breaker."
SOGUT_INTRO_3 "But Osman had more than just his strength. Soon he offered his services to the Rum Sultan and started dreaming of an empire of his own. His successes as a commander quickly spread and Persians, Arabs, and Turks, all fleeing the Mongol onslaught in the East, wanted to join under his command. Still, the way was long as Osman had to start almost from scratch in a place surrounded by rivals and hostile tribes."
SOGUT_INTRO_4 "Not to mention the Byzantines, who were now relying on aid from their Christian Brethren to the West. There had been some rumors about a former Knight Templar who was bringing a Spanish army to aid the old Byzantine Empire but Osman wasn't worried about mere rumors, as he knew his carefully crafted out plans would succeed. He would be the beginning of something that would determine the course of history for centuries to come..."
YORK_INTRO_1 "Shouts of approval rang around the great hall after the sons of Ragnar finished speaking. Ravens flew upwards, eager to tell the Aesir of the good tidings, no doubt. Moments later, the ravens called down and the sky flashed with lightning and boomed with thunder, signaling their approval. Reveling in the favor of the Gods, the immense crowd of warriors began a feast."
YORK_INTRO_2 "Days later, the mustering began. Kings, Jarls, Huskarls, Berserkers, and common folk alike had gathered, all answering the call of Ragnar's sons. Great and proven warriors they were, and eager for vengeance for the dishonorable slaying of Ragnar by the Northumbrian king Aella. Ragnar's son Ivar has sworn to carve the blood eagle on Aella in retribution for his actions."
YORK_INTRO_3 "The scene of preparation for the departure of the army was quite a sight to behold. Hundreds of longships assembled with full crews of good Norsemen, and enough supplies were loaded on board to last the army months. The best of all the Northlands, preparing for the great battle of their Age. Odin's hall would soon be swelling with new warriors, for his Valkyries would no doubt be eagerly observing the campaign."
YORK_INTRO_4 "Ragnar's sons approached a small company of the warriors gathered with an important quest- to scout the British Isles and establish a camp suitable for the army to use as a base from which to attack the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. As a skald, I was tasked with doing what I have always done- recording the great exploits and triumphs of my fellows and compiling a saga that will be passed down from generation to generation."
YORK_INTRO_5 "Thor was pleased with us, for the seas were benign and the winds favorable, allowing our five ships a serene passage west from Scandinavia. We had knowledge of four great Anglo-Saxon kingdoms- Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia, and Wessex. York, the seat of Northumbria, was our target, but it would be imperative to avoid being spotted and keep the element of surprise. Even after making camp, we would need to await our army."

BUKHARA_OUTRO_1 "The White Huns possessed great military power but their lack of organization made them unable to fight on multiple fronts. When we Persians and our allied Turkish tribes launched our two-pronged attack, the White Huns were quickly defeated. The mighty heavy-armored Persian cavalry and swift, accurate Turkish horse archers crushed the disorientated enemy within eight days. The victory at the battle of Bukhara was of great significance to us, for the White Huns faded into history and the Gokturks and Persians ended up dividing the conquered land among themselves. The great endeavors of our great emperor, Khosrau have restored Persia to its former glory..."
CYPRUS_OUTRO_1 "The conquest of Cyprus was more important strategically than it seems. It became a naval base from which the Eastern Mediterranean could be controlled in addition to the ports of the Holy Land. Having conquered Cyprus, Richard set sail towards the Holy Land and finally arrived. There he soon had to face the fact that he was left alone to conduct the Crusade. Frederick Barbarossa had drowned in a river, and Philip Augustus turned back to France, having claimed illness."
CYPRUS_OUTRO_2 "Despite his own serious illness, Richard captured the city of Acre, breaking a siege with which the German and French crusader armies had been struggling for 93 weeks. After recovering from his disease, he faced his great counterpart, Saladin, who was no less noble than Richard himself. During the rest of the Crusade the two faced each other in several battles, most of which ended in victories for Richard."
CYPRUS_OUTRO_3 "Most notable was the battle of Jaffa, where with only 2,000 foot soldiers and 54 horsemen he managed to rout an army of 7,000 Muslim horsemen. In this battle, he proved that he was the greatest strategist of his time. His success even extended to the capture of Jerusalem, but he did not have enough military force left to hold it. The Third Crusade ended with a treaty between the two great opponents, Saladin and Richard."
DOSPILAS_OUTRO_1 "The king of Calakmul, Yuknoom Che'en II, invaded Dos Pilas and managed to take B'alaj Chan K'awiil captive. He gave the young prince a choice- either to be sacrificed to the gods, or to betray his brother and become a vassal of Calakmul. B'alaj Chan K'awiil, jealous of his brother, recognized Yuknoom Che'en II as his overlord and agreed to fight against Tikal. However, he also started fighting for his own power and the glory of Dos Pilas instead of just that of Calakmul."
DOSPILAS_OUTRO_2 "At the end, the outcome of the war was inconclusive. B'alaj Chan K'awiil betrayed his father and brother by sacking Tikal, but he never became the true king of the city. Instead, struck by guilt, he went back to Dos Pilas and spent the remainder of his days there. The war was won by Tikal after several years. Nonetheless, it never really recovered from the betrayal of one of its dearest sons...  \"Ichik!\", I hear a strange but familiar voice saying. \"Ichik! Wake up!\" "
DOSPILAS_OUTRO_3 "When I finally open my eyes, I see my sister in front of me. \"You've fallen asleep again brother. Everyone is already to bed!\" Slowly I get up and walk with my sister to our hut. On the way there I say to her: \"When I grow up, I want to go hunt like our father and brothers. I want to see these stone mountains and see where B'alaj Chan K'awiil reigned with my own eyes.\""
HONFOGLALAS_OUTRO_1 "\"It would seem that they are a resilient people if they managed to survive such hard times and still claim a new homeland.\" observed Romanos. \"Yes, and today the entirety of Europe is experiencing that toughness. They have conducted several raids into Byzantine lands as well.\" \"But why did they turn against us, and why is it so difficult to defend against them?\" Romanos asked. \"Well, this is diplomacy- you still have a lot to learn.\""
HONFOGLALAS_OUTRO_2 "Secondly, it is their sly tactics that makes them so difficult to deal with. They wear light armor, which makes them highly mobile. They launch their attacks without warning, raid the countryside and leave quickly before a defensive force can be mustered. If they are forced to fight a pitched battle, then they prefer to avoid melee combat. They feign a retreat instead, and then cast a rain of arrows at their pursuers."
HONFOGLALAS_OUTRO_3 "Their preferred weapons are the scimitar, lances and the dreadful recurve bow.\" \"This is terrifying! Will anyone be able to stop them, or will they conquer Europe?\" \"I am sure that sooner or later someone will defeat them. Their tactics are already known. They will have to adapt to European customs or else disappear from the map,\" the wise emperor concluded, snuffing out the candles."
KURIKARA_OUTRO_1 "Thunder boomed as spears of lightning pierced the sky, mingled with the cries of battle. Driven back from the walls of Kurikara, the Taira army had been in steady retreat as Minamoto no Yoritomo led droves of Minamoto and Hojo samurai to victory after victory. Smoke rose from the Taira siege camps and floated with the wind towards Kyoto, an ominous shadow of doom approaching those inside the city."
KURIKARA_OUTRO_2 "Offering thanks and prayers to the gods, Yoritomo advanced, halting and making camp outside Kyoto. For days, siege engines pounded the walls of the Imperial City, reducing its great castles to piles of rubble. As the main gate fell, Minamoto clansmen poured into the city, killing all in their path, while Yoritomo strode triumphantly to the Imperial Palace. Entering it, he slew the royal guards stationed there and planted his banner."
KURIKARA_OUTRO_3 "With the power of the Taira broken and their capital taken, the war turned in Yoritomo's favor. In one fell swoop, he seized a third of the Taira dominion and turned a doomed rebellion into a triumphant affair. It would take two more long years, but Yoritomo's prowess as a commander ensured victory at the battle of Dan-no-ura in the year 1185, ending the Genpei War and ushering in the new era of the Kamakura Shogunate."
LANGSHAN_OUTRO_1 "Qian Yuanguan used various tactics during the battle- he ordered his men to throw ashes into the faces of the enemy sailors and to use sand to protect the decks of their own ships from fire. Later, after his ascension to the throne, he was named Wenmu, or civil and solemn. King Wenmu's use of gunpowder to ignite his flamethrowers' oil and burn the enemy fleet is the first recorded use of the explosive mixture for millitary purposes. Although not a decisive end to the Chinese civil war, this battle is probably the most important event of its time and changed the future of the entire world."
SOGUT_OUTRO_1 "With the first successes of Osman came the first Ghazi warriors from the East. And after years of successful expansion, his small band of warriors quickly grew into a mighty army. Rich cities which had been in the hands of the Byzantines for almost a millennium fell to the Turks of Osman. The only one who stood in his way was Roger de Flor, the former Knight Templar and later condottiero, and his Catalan Company."
SOGUT_OUTRO_2 "He was a genius commander and the only real rival for Osman. Several times did he manage to defeat the Turkish armies and even almost drove them out of Anatolia. But just at the moment he was to succeed, old politics and internal Byzantine feuds got the best of him. Roger de Flor was treacherously killed by the same empire he had fought so hard for to defend. When hearing the news of his death his loyal Catalan Company started devastating the Byzantine lands and afterwards left for home with the body of their commander."
SOGUT_OUTRO_3 "Osman had always respected his great rival whom he believed to be his equal but Roger's death opened the way for his ambitions, and soon his men conquered the lands around Sogut. Just before he died, Osman looked West across the Bosphorus and even prepared the invasion of Europe for his successors. Osman died as a satisfied man, for he had created his own empire- he had founded the Ottoman Empire..."
YORK_OUTRO_1 "Odin and Thor have willed us to glorious success. Over the past several months, I have seen more gold, more riches, and more carnage than I could possibly have dreamed of. The smell of smoke is still inundating to say the least- these people surely must think that they have been struck by the hand of the God that they have tried to force on us time and time again. Our gods are stronger."
YORK_OUTRO_2 "True to their word, Ragnar's sons carved the blood eagle on the back of the cowardly Aella as a warning to the Northumbrians and laughed at the knowledge that Aella's weakness doomed him to eternal scorn in Niflheim, for Odin has no place for cravens. The haughty Anglo-Saxons have met their match in our glorious force, for we have easily cut a broad swath through their land."
YORK_OUTRO_3 "The treasures we have seen are without equal, and the land is fertile and rich. With the locals all but conquered, I think we will stay here a while. Ivar, Bjorn, Sigurd, and Ubbe all desire to carve out kingdoms in this fruitful location, and I am excited at the prospect of continuing to chronicle their deeds. I do believe that I have come up with a fitting title for this legendary saga- The Tale of Ragnar's Sons and the Age of the Vikings."

86303 "1. The Tambralingas control a pair of bases in Khmer lands. Once those are dealt with, the entire northeastern landmass will be under Khmer control.\n\n2. The majority of the battles in this scenario will be fought at sea. Invest heavily in a navy and organize your economy accordingly.\n\n3. Conquering the central islands will give you access to numerous mineral resources (gold and stone) as well as a springboard from which to take control of the water.\n\n4. Most of the land on this map is within range of the sea, making cannon galleons an attractive option.\n\n5. Stay apprised of events occurring across the sea - without aid, the Chola fortress will not hold out forever."
86304 "Your scouts report:\n\n- The Khmer army (Cyan) is stationed in the southern, coastal portion of the Khmer Empire, preparing for the conflict that is sure to break out in the Gulf of Thailand. It should be capable of dealing with any initial land-based threats, but the Khmer fleet will need to grow rapidly if it is to take the fight across the sea to Tambralinga and Srivijaya lands.\n\n- The Cholas (Green), allies of the Khmer, have conducted an impressive amphibious assault of the Kingdom of Tambralinga, seizing a powerful coastal fortress and establishing a foothold on the Malay Peninsula. Their elephants, swordsmen, archers, and light cavalry make for an impressive army, but they will require aid if they are to survive the Tambralinga and Srivijaya onslaught.\n\n- The Tambralingas (Orange) recently suffered a defeat at the hands of the Chola arrivals, but are far from broken, having struck out and established two military bases to the northwest of the Khmer lands. Their light infantry and javelineers will harass their enemies by land, while their navy will attempt to keep the Khmer and Chola forces divided.\n\n- The Srivijayans (Blue) command a vast thalassocratic empire from their power base in the south of the map. Droves of elephants, swordsmen, archers, and onagers will provide a staunch resistance to any land-based incursions, while their fabled navy has hitherto ruled the seas with an iron fist."

Their military consists primarily of swordsmen, ballistae, and elephants.\n\n- The Dai Viet (Yellow) hold a fortress to the far north, watching the conflict to the south with much interest.

You conquer villages by destroying the towers within them. Once a tower is destroyed, one of your towers will replace it.\n\n3. Battle Elephants are great for taking down enemy towers.\n\n4. You can find Mongol and Javanese equipment scattered around the map. It will help you boost your technologies.\n\n5. The Mongols cannot be trusted. Their ultimate goal is to subdue all of Southeast Asia!\n\n6. The castle in Kediri gets regular supplies over land which are used to train more soldiers. Blocking these supplies will be vital for victory."
87005 "Your scouts report:\n\n-Our great ruler, Raden Wijaya (Orange) fled east to escape Singhasari after a failed rebellion against them. Here in eastern Java he now plans to build a new kindgom.\n\n-The Mongols (Green) had sent diplomats in name of Kublai Khan to demand tribute from the Indonesian kingdoms. However Singhasari killed their diplomats and now a Mongol army has arrived south to punish them. Since we're both enemy of Singhasari they might be willing to from a pact against them but once Singhasari is weakened we should be smart and break the pact at an opportune moment to gain the upperhand. The Mongols have brought their horses and will raise an army of Light cavalry, Cavalry Archers, Mangudai and siege units.\n\n-East, right next to our starting position is Singhasari (Blue), our former overlord. They have the support of many of the nobility which makes them a very strong opponent. They'll be very aggressive and attack us with Crossbowmen, Cavalry Archers, Elephants, Long Swordsmen and Mangonels.\n\n-To the west of us lies the fortified castle of Kediri (Teal). It's in a very strategic position and Singhasari can control the surrounding villages from here. If they have the supplies, they'll train Knights, Crossbowmen, Pikemen and Elephants."
87006 "<ORANGE>Raden Wijaya: Both the Kediri and the Mongols refuse to talk to my diplomats. I'll show them."

87106 "Your scouts report:\n\n- Gajah Mada and his army (Red) has arrived north east of the city. You have to trust on the help of the locals to set up a strong camp to siege the city.\n\n- North of your army, the prime minister Arya Tadah (Purple), has also arrived and is awaiting your support to commence the attack.\n\n- King Jayanegara (Yellow) is trapped within the city walls, surrounded by hostile rebels. His royal guards are pretty tough but eventually they'll succumb to the rebel attacks.\n\n- The city of Trowulan (Orange) is occupied by Rebels. The more stronger units are assigned to the walls to fend of our attacks and consist of Arbalests, Champions, Elephants, Onagers and Halberdiers. The rebel army under the command of Rakrian Kuti (Blue) himself will attack our king.

Because of the restricted population limit and resources available it's a good idea to rely on fortifications to defend your land against enemy ships.\n\n6. Sunda won't be very aggressive unless you attack them first or expand in their territory so instead of destroying them immediately you can also choose to expand your naval empire first."
87205 "Your scouts report:\n\n- The Majapahit (You) control the eastern half of the island of Java, while Sunda (Blue) controls the western half. The Majapahit royal family has good ties with Sunda so they will not attack at first but it might be in our interest to assert control over the island before expanding to the other islands. Sunda will train Skirmishers and Knights.\n\n- Our colonies (Teal, Purple, Gray and Orange) will start colonizing Bali, Sulawesi, and Borneo. These islands are to the east and north of our starting location and are rich in resources.\n\n- West of Java, on the island of Sumatra, lies the kingdom of Dharmasraya (Green). The kingdom wields a strong force of Swordsmen, Crossbowmen, Ballista Elephants, Galleons, and Fire Ships. Dharmasraya is the most likely to aggressively attack us.\n\n- To the north lies Malaysia, part of the Asian continent. Here the Tumasik have broken free from their former overlords and have built the mighty city of Singapore. They compete with us over the control of the sparsely inhabited islands which we are trying to colonize. It is unlikely they will attack us directly before they have destroyed our colonies.

Fish is probably the best way to get food in this region. It saves the wood from building farms and that wood can instead be used for ships.\n\n3. The enemy has a strong naval presence. Building fortifications on the islands can help defend holdings and let you concentrate your ships in fewer locations.\n\n4. Some enemies have Sea Fortifications. The best way to deal with these is with a lot of Cannon Galleons. Using other ships to distract the fire coming from the buildings will also work.\n\n5. Population limit is set to 125."
87305 "Your scouts report:\n\n- Your navy, or what's left of it, arrived north and made landfall on one of the islands.\n\n- Nearby there's a village which already pledged fealty to the Majapahit. We just have to find it in order for us to use its docks.\n\n- To the east the Kutai (Blue) control many of the smaller islands. They are mainly pirates and rely on small but fast ships. They will also use rafts filled with gunpowder.\n\n- The Makassar (Green) live on the other side of the eastern archipelago and southwest of our starting location. They are well-fortified and better equipped then the Kutai. They mainly rely on War Galleys and Fire Ships to deal with enemy vessels but also possess feared archers for land battles. We definitely can expect them to try to raid our islands.\n\n- Farther to the south are the Luwu (Yellow). The most technologically advanced, their island will be very difficult to capture because of the large towers defending it. They are also very accustomed to gunpowder so they will employ their vessels and towers with cannons."

Getting rid of them before attacking the Sunda in the city might be a good idea. Destroying their camps will stop their raids.\n\n5. Sunda will be able to train more units using Trowulan's infrastructure. We need to capture these buildings by putting soldiers next to them.\n\n6. Gajah Mada won't allow the usage of Siege Weapons lest we destroy the city. On the other hand elephants are great alternatives for taking down buildings."

The fort is small and lean in resources and cannot withstand many attacks.\n\n- Trowulan (Yellow) is the capital of the Majapahit Empire. King Hayam Wuruk has his palace east of it. The city is well fortified but not hostile to us.\n\n- The Sunda (Blue) who arrived in Trowulan were here for a royal wedding, but, upon realizing they had been betrayed, took up arms and consolidated their position in the city. If we want them to capitulate, we must break into the city and destroy their army.\n\n- Outside of the capital, to the west and north, are several Majapahit villages (Purple) and army bases (Green). When we reach them, we take control of them.\n\n- Because Gajah Mada spent much of his time campaigning, the Bandits (Cyan) in this region have become very powerful.

It would be wise to carefully observe your surroundings and look for the best spot to construct one.\n\n3. The Ming have many fortified camps in the region. It is not advised to attack these.\n\n4. The Vietnamese unique unit, the Rattan Archer, is very effective against the many Chu ko nu the Ming will produce.\n\n5. Be careful while venturing on the roads. Ming patrols are abundant!"

Bui Be and Luu Nhan Chu are to the west preparing for an assault on Nghe An's western gates.\n\n-Nghe An (cyan) is to the south and very well defended.

BURMESE1_INTRO_1 "1538 AD. Year Eight of the reign of King Tabinshwehti."
BURMESE1_INTRO_2 "Over two decades ago, before I was even born, an old village shaman came to our little mountain kingdom of Toungoo. He claimed to speak with the nats, the ancestral spirits worshiped by our people before the coming of Buddhism."
BURMESE1_INTRO_3 "The nats had told the shaman that an ancient warrior prince would be reincarnated in our kingdom. This prince would rule as the Cakkavatti, the universal ruler embodying Buddhist virtue. Soon after, a son named Tabinshwehti was reborn to one of the King's wives. At the same time, a servant girl had herself just birthed a son and she was made the newborn prince's wet nurse. After all these years, I know the story of King Tabinshwehti's birth well. I am the son of his wet nurse. Though we came from very different origins, the nats had joined the King and I."
BURMESE1_INTRO_4 "Though the nats prophesied King Tabinshwehti's greatness, they blessed me as well. But not in the way my mother sees it. She does not believe that the King is the one the shaman spoke of. She says the nats are not that simple; they are tricky spirits who mislead with their blessings. But I tell my mother that I am no warrior prince! The nats have blessed me, though not as she believes. Because the King and I both suckled from my mother, he has treated me like kin and made me his loyal general."
BURMESE1_INTRO_5 "But with every blessing comes a curse. Our kingdom is under attack by the Shan, a warrior people of the far north. Our city's walls cannot stop them so I have proposed to my King that we attack south, away from the northern threat. The Kingdom of Hanthawaddy is a wealthy land and home of the Mon people but it is ruled by a paranoid and cowardly king."
BURMESE1_INTRO_6 "As we march south, the nats bring fear into the Mon king's heart. He flees his lands for the safety of his allies just as a frightened water buffalo runs to his herd after smelling a tiger. The King and I are the Burmese tigers, chasing after that buffalo!"
BURMESE1_OUTRO_1 "To reward my service in battle, my King bestowed a name of great honor upon me: 'Bayinnaung', which means 'King's Elder Brother'. Though he is a King and I am but the son of a servant girl, he embraced me and declared a shared blood! I am no longer a simple servant. I am Bayinnaung. I am a prince. "

BURMESE2_INTRO_1 "1543 AD. Year Thirteen of the reign of King Tabinshwehti."
BURMESE2_INTRO_2 "Our conquest of Lower Burma has brought fear to the Shan warlords. They call upon their allies, the Kingdom of Ava and the mighty Rakhine people, to raise armies against us."
BURMESE2_INTRO_3 "My King and I march north to Upper Burma, following the pilgrimage trail to Pagan, city of 10,000 temples. From this city, the ancient Kings of Pagan once ruled over a united Burmese people. If my King is to rule all of Burma, he must be crowned in Pagan."
BURMESE2_INTRO_4 "I will march ahead of my King to secure the city while he leads the army against our enemies. I will make all preparations for his coronation in that ancient capital. I will make sure that my brother fulfills his prophesied destiny.  "
BURMESE2_OUTRO_1 "Our kingdom is mighty under King Tabinshwehti. The greatest monks, warriors, and administrators in all of Burma come to our court. The King has made me his chief minister but I worry for my brother."
BURMESE2_OUTRO_2 "A man from Portugal has stumbled into the court and intrigued the King with his foreign ways and a bottle of strong wine. I fear that the blessed path that we have walked together has now come to a cursed end. "

BURMESE3_INTRO_1 "1550 AD. Year Twenty of the reign of King Tabinshwehti."
BURMESE3_INTRO_2 "I am the chief minister of a kingdom without a king. The man from Portugal has corrupted King Tabinshwehti. My lord has taken to drinking and forgotten both the ways of Buddhism and the blessings of the nats. He leaves with the foreigner for weeks at a time on long, wine-filled hunting trips. Even when he is in court, the King orders executions in drunken fits!"
BURMESE3_INTRO_3 "Many of the kingdom's officials have pleaded with me to depose the King and rule Burma justly. But though I love my country, I cannot betray my brother!"
BURMESE3_INTRO_4 "I should have known rebellion would come. A monk named Htaw, brother of the dead Hanthawaddy king, incites a revolt in the south. The King is leaving on yet another hunting trip but he has ordered me to take the army to defeat this rebel. I will follow my King's instructions but I am concerned. A minister named Sawhtut is eager to see me leave. I do not know what trouble he has brewing."
BURMESE3_OUTRO_1 "Sawhtut paid two swordsmen of the King's bodyguard to enter my brother's tent as he slept. Their pockets heavy with the traitor's gold, they drew their swords and beheaded my brother. His body was found by a monk and quietly cremated. I would throw away this crown if it brought my brother back but he is among the nats now.  "
BURMESE3_OUTRO_2 "The nats were tricky just as my mother told me. They took my brother from me. I should not be King, I should not be the Cakkavatti, but the nats made it so. I reject them. "

BURMESE4_INTRO_1 "1563 AD. Year Thirteen of the reign of Bayinnaung, King of all Burma."
BURMESE4_INTRO_2 "The tiger rules the forest but he is always hungry. It is the same with me as I look to the Thai kingdoms of the East. I have ruled for thirteen years but how am I the Cakkavatti if I am only King of Burma?"
BURMESE4_INTRO_3 "Ayutthaya is the strongest of the Thai kingdoms. Her king, Chakkraphat, has defied me for too long! He encourages the rebellion of one of my vassals, the King of Lan Na. Even now, he sends his daughter to marry the ruler of the kingdom of Lan Xang, in exchange for an alliance against me! But these schemes alone do not drive me to war."
BURMESE4_INTRO_4 "I know that Chakkraphat has seven white elephants, a symbol of luck and divine favor. Already, I hear the murmurs in the court. People with more spirit than sense whisper that if I truly am the Cakkavatti, why would the nats have blessed Chakkraphat with the elephants?"
BURMESE4_INTRO_5 "I cannot allow this Thai king nor the nats themselves to defy me! I will send my armies east but they will not just bring war. I will send Buddhist monks with them to carry the word of my blessed Buddhist rule."
BURMESE4_OUTRO_1 "I have conquered my enemies and made them bow before me. I have purged the land of the nats, building stupas and monasteries where once the spirits ruled."
BURMESE4_OUTRO_2 "I am the Conqueror of the Ten Directions. I am master of all between the foothills of Tibet and the waters of Malacca, between the plains of India and the mountain jungle of Vietnam. The Kings of Sri Lanka and Portugal send me gifts from across the ocean. The Emperors of India and China call me their equal. My life will be written in the legends of three nations for centuries."
BURMESE4_OUTRO_3 "I am Bayinnaung. I am the Cakkavatti."

BURMESE5_INTRO_1 "1580 AD. Year Thirty of the reign of the Cakkavatti."
BURMESE5_INTRO_2 "Though the tiger grows old, his hunger does not leave him. It grows with age, driving him to fresh hunting grounds and giving him a taste for more dangerous prey!"
BURMESE5_INTRO_3 "For thirty years, I have ruled Burma and made a dozen kings bow before me. But what will they say of my life? That I ruled by the sword and killed many men? That I, a King, was a slave to my desire? The Old Tiger is stubborn but he knows when his hunger has gotten the best of him."
BURMESE5_INTRO_4 "My sons lead the army to conquer the Rakhine coast: the gateway to India. They are like their father once, chasing in vain across the earth for their greatest victory..."
BURMESE5_OUTRO_1 "My father did not live to see the conquest of the Rakhine. The doctor claimed the lung sickness took his life, but I know my father. No man who rode a charging elephant into throngs of Shan archers, who stormed the cities of the Thai, or who ruled an empire not seen since the ancient days would die from a mere cough! "
BURMESE5_OUTRO_2 "No. My father left this world because he chose to. There was only one conquest left worthy of a man like Bayinnaung."
BURMESE5_OUTRO_3 "I know legends will be told of him. I know old shamans will tell prophesies. But no deed would match his final act. Greater in battle than the man who would conquer a thousand men is he who would conquer just one - himself. "

MALAY1_INTRO_1 "What drives a king and his people to expand their lands to the very edge of the unknown? Why are the people willing to sacrifice their lives and that of their families for a ruler they have never met?"
MALAY1_INTRO_2 "The legends of our ancestors are what drive us. The way people speak of our predecessors and what they managed to achieve. Everybody here has heard of the great Srivijaya Empire - a great power of the past that exerted its rule upon all of the islands and even dared to dictate high tolls to the Indian and Chinese trading ships that passed between them. Sadly, that same greed also led to their downfall."
MALAY1_INTRO_3 "The animal that we hold in highest esteem in our culture is the Kancil, and foreigners laugh at us when they hear about it. 'Why would you ever think so highly of such a small and benign creature?', they ask. But that is because they know nothing of its heart. Despite its unimpressive appearance, the Kancil has the ability to overcome any obstacle, defeat much larger adversaries through sheer cunning, and possesses a bravery like that of no other animal."
MALAY1_INTRO_4 "Just like the kancil, small and benign as we are now, we will raise a new empire from the ground up - the Majapahit Empire - larger and stronger than any before it! Our legends will ripple through the ages and we will be remembered!"
MALAY1_OUTRO_1 "And this is how our founder, Arya Wiraraja created the Majapahit Empire from the small village he was given. Defeating his Javanese overlord and the mighty Mongol invaders, by being cunning just like the kancil. I'm certain the gods have favored him and his family. This is why I, Gajah Mada, commander of the elite guard of the Majapahit kings, have sworn to serve them for the rest of my life."

MALAY2_INTRO_1 "I've been suspecting it for a while now but today it became reality. Powers within the Majapahit Empire threaten to bring down our beloved king. While I was on an errands run, a nobleman called Rakrian Kuti has taken up arms and is besieging the royal palace with the king still inside it. Things are looking grim but luckily the king still has many supporters, including the prime minister, Arya Tadah. Together we've decided to free the king before dealing with the rebellion. Hopefully we'll be in time to save him."
MALAY2_OUTRO_1 "We managed to crush the unlawful rebellion of that treacherous usurper and during the great festivities that followed I've been promoted to a higher position. However a part of me is starting to regret saving our king. Jayanegara believes he's untouchable now and his behavior is becoming increasingly immoral. He desires the wives and daughters of his subordinates, making him very hated among the nobility. Some even call him a 'weak villain'. Tribhuwana, his stepsister who I've known since she was young has told me in confidence that the king is now also showing inappropriate behavior towards her. One way or another the king's actions have to stop."

MALAY3_INTRO_1 "This afternoon the king died. His doctor murdered him during a minor operation. Once I heard of this news, I had the doctor immediately arrested and killed. The king's stepsister, Tribhuwana is now the queen regent. One of her first actions as queen was to retire the former prime minister, Arya Tadah, after it became clear that he had failed to do his job and I was made prime minister in his stead."
MALAY3_INTRO_2 "Immediately I swore an oath in front of everyone in the throne room. I would prove that I would be the greatest prime minister of all of Majapahit's history and I would not eat any spices or fruits until I had conquered the entire known Indonesian archipelago!"
MALAY3_OUTRO_1 "Even my closest friends were at first doubtful of my promises but I showed them. One by one, our mighty army and majestic fleets conquered the surrounding territories. From the paradise island of Bali to the old ruins of the Srivijaya Empire. All are now under control of the Majapahit Empire. Just like I said it would..."

MALAY4_INTRO_1 "Time is relentless as I'm growing older and older. The queen abdicated now that her son, Hayam Wuruk has come of age. Nevertheless this does not affect my objectives. Retaining my position as prime minister, I'll continue my military campaigns. My work still isn't done as my oath is yet to be fully fulfilled. Majapahit's navy will go east, towards the rich tropical islands. There are as many as the stars in the sky but they too will recognize my authority... and that of the king, of course."
MALAY4_OUTRO_1 "Never before has an empire controlled so much of the Indonesian archipelago. The Majapahit Empire is truly blessed. Even the Chinese and Indians have recognized its power. All that remains for me to fulfill my oath is to take the one remaining kingdom on the island of Java, the kingdom of Sunda. They can no longer be allowed to exist on the very same island as us. Even though my king maintains good relationships with them, I'll find a way for them to submit to my will."

MALAY5_INTRO_1 "I came up with a plan for the Sunda 'issue'. I've arranged a marriage between my king and one of their princesses. They think the wedding document secured an alliance with us, but in fact, it states they will submit to Majapahit rule. My king has ordered me to go to Bubat Square in our capital to welcome the princess as she arrives with her family and escort them to our palace in safety. Even he doesn't know of the plot."
MALAY5_INTRO_2 "I don't know how they'll react when they find out the truth but I won't give them the chance to do anything about it. As we speak, my army encroaches on Bubat square. Faced with the harsh reality of the situation, the Sunda will have no choice but to continue the ceremony."
MALAY5_OUTRO_1 "Things turned bad really quickly. My army surrounded the Sunda royal family at Bubat Square and I ordered them to put down their weapons. I was sure they would comply. I certainly didn't expect them to draw their weapons and attack my army when they were so vastly outnumbered. But feeling humiliated by the treaty, that's what they did. Outnumbered and surrounded from all sides they bravely fought till the very end."
MALAY5_OUTRO_2 "My own king and his family, the family I had spent my entire life serving, were disgusted by my actions. When the king summoned me, I could see the disappointment and loathing in his eyes. In tears, he told me that his bride-to-be had committed suicide after the events that took place, and that I had ruined the reputation of our empire. "
MALAY5_OUTRO_3 "Many in the Majapahit Empire wanted me dead, but because of my long years of service the king did not desire my demise. Instead, he told me to withdraw from the royal court and to retreat to a small mansion in the countryside. Death would have been a less harsh punishment than having to live with this shame."
MALAY5_OUTRO_4 "And so, here I am. A lonely old man, once ambitious and young, now trapped in this secluded place. I realize I was not smart, like the kancil, but rather was greedy and blind, like the animals it misleads. The assassination of the first king, removing the former prime minister, all the schemes I had in place, ... I let nothing come in the way of my ambitions. And now I have to pay the price..."

KHMER1_INTRO_1 "Forward march! We do not stop until the sun falls beneath the treeline."
KHMER1_INTRO_2 "I am Sangrama, honored general of the Khmer Empire, tasked with quelling a rebellion. Just a year after the passing of the revered Suryavarman I, his successor faces staunch opposition. It threatens to dismantle the empire that Suryavarman took nearly five decades to build."
KHMER1_INTRO_3 "Inspiring an army of largely levy soldiery is difficult. Most are simple farmers and craftsmen, strangers to the ways of war and the grim chaos of battle. They should understand the cause for which they fight."
KHMER1_INTRO_4 "As we trudged through the mud, I summoned the captains to the front of the line. Knowing them personally, these men speak to the troops directly under their command in a different way than I ever could. I would tell them of the events that occurred before many of them were born."
KHMER1_INTRO_5 "Suryavarman was once little more than a magnate with a minor claim to the throne held by another. Udayadityavarman I had established his seat in Angkor, claiming the entire empire as his dominion."
KHMER1_INTRO_6 "Gathering his army, Suryavarman marched on Angkor from the west, establishing a camp not far from the city."
KHMER1_OUTRO_1 "The captains listened eagerly as I gave my account of the usurpation. Despite a numerical disadvantage, Suryavarman’s tactical acumen proved critical to the success of such a risky offensive. Droves of Udayadityavarman’s troops fell to Suryavarman’s disciplined infantry and elephant corps."
KHMER1_OUTRO_2 "Entering Angkor, Suryavarman gave the order to his disciplined army that the city was to be left intact, the civilians unharmed. He would not begin his rule by committing acts of savage tyranny upon his own people."

KHMER2_INTRO_1 "Ascent to power does not come easily. Once the head of one beast is removed, three spring to take its place. Such was the case with Suryavarman’s enemies."
KHMER2_INTRO_2 "Rebel factions sprung up to the north, east, and south of Angkor. Legions of disgruntled soldiers marched on the city, threatening to topple Suryavarman just as quickly as he had ascended to power."
KHMER2_INTRO_3 "The most dangerous rebel faction was led by Jayaviravarman, a warlord from Malaysia with a distant claim to the throne. Advancing from the south at a rapid pace, he acquired much support from the local populace."
KHMER2_INTRO_4 "Suryavarman had to act quickly. The rebel forces, were they to unite, would present quite a challenge to an army that had only recently emerged victorious from a grueling campaign."
KHMER2_INTRO_5 "There was precious little time to spare."
KHMER2_OUTRO_1 "Humans are interesting creatures. At times they display incredible brilliance, and yet at others they behave like obstinate fools!"
KHMER2_OUTRO_2 "One can only wonder at the folly that caused the rebel factions to not coordinate their forces. A bundle of sticks is difficult to break, but individual twigs snap as if they were bits of straw."
KHMER2_OUTRO_3 "Suryavarman’s victory assured that this lesson would not be forgotten."

KHMER3_INTRO_1 "As the empire boomed, its neighbors became wary. A growing tiger will gorge itself on the prey that it deems most vulnerable."
KHMER3_INTRO_2 "Some dreaded the looming war and prayed that their fears were unjustified. Others prepared for it. The Kingdom of Tambralinga, a vassal of the great Srivijayan thalassocracy, felt particularly threatened."
KHMER3_INTRO_3 "The empire was surrounded by hostile neighbors and conflict was imminent! It seemed that the only thing left to question would be who would strike first. Suryavarman was wise enough to know that passivity would only lead to disaster."
KHMER3_INTRO_4 "The various Burmese kingdoms to the west of the empire behaved with hostility, but a potential ally lay beyond. The Cholas, a powerful dynasty based in the south of the Indian subcontinent, had interests that aligned with those of the Khmer."
KHMER3_INTRO_5 "Dispatching a diplomatically skilled envoy laden with gifts could be enough to convince Rajendra Chola that an alliance with Suryavarman would be to his liking."
KHMER3_OUTRO_1 "Despite the hardships of the journey through hostile territory, the diplomatic convoy arrived in Chola lands largely intact. Rajendra Chola was pleased with the gifts that the envoy lavished upon him."
KHMER3_OUTRO_2 "Especially impressive was the grand chariot, a work fashioned by the finest craftsmen in Angkor! Generous offerings and well-chosen words go a long way with a magnanimous ruler."
KHMER3_OUTRO_3 "A bargain was struck, and the envoy returned to Angkor, harbinger of pleasant news."

KHMER4_INTRO_1 "With the alliance made and the pieces on the board, conflict was inevitable. The Tambralingas themselves posed only a token threat, but they had the support of the immense naval empire of Srivijaya."
KHMER4_INTRO_2 "The prowess of the Srivijayan navy was unmatched, but their coalition was at a tactical disadvantage. The Khmer forces threatened the enemy by land from the north and by sea from the east, while the Cholas struck out from the west. The enemy found themselves surrounded on all sides."
KHMER4_INTRO_3 "Suryavarman sent word to the Chola force to establish a foothold on the Malay Peninsula. Taking the initiative, he ordered the outfitting of a massive navy to challenge the Srivijayans and Tambralingas for maritime supremacy."
KHMER4_INTRO_4 "Everything hinged on the success of the Chola force that had landed on the mainland. If they could present a formidable enough threat and occupy the enemy land forces, Suryavarman would be able to wrest control of the water and launch a devastating amphibious invasion."
KHMER4_INTRO_5 "If the Cholas were driven from their foothold, the Khmer would be forced to face down their opponents alone - a prospect with which Suryavarman would not be particularly excited."
KHMER4_OUTRO_1 "Storms raged as wooden vessels rammed into each other, a deafening sound prefaced by the whistling of projectiles through the air. Thousands of men sank below the angry waves, never to rise again."
KHMER4_OUTRO_2 "The Chola land force fought bravely, holding to the last. Just as it seemed that they were consigned to defeat at the hands of the Tambralinga-Srivijaya force, salvation arrived in the form of swarms of Khmer."
KHMER4_OUTRO_3 "Victory has a glorious taste. Over the course of a single conflict, the influence and power of the empire were raised to unprecedented levels."

KHMER5_INTRO_1 "With the maritime rivals of the empire crushed, Suryavarman set his sights on the mainland. As the war with the Tambralinga-Srivijaya alliance had progressed, it had not escaped his attention that rivals closer to home had been plotting and wishing for his ruin."
KHMER5_INTRO_2 "The rulers of the various Burmese and Cham kingdoms slunk around in the shadows like disgraced cravens. Instead of recognizing the superiority of their larger neighbor, they deviously plotted its downfall and encouraged rebellion within it!"
KHMER5_INTRO_3 "This behavior was unacceptable. Suryavarman’s enemies may have been too intimidated to face the Khmer juggernaut head-on, but Suryavarman had no such reservations. These provocations had provided an optimal casus belli."
KHMER5_INTRO_4 "It was high time that the empire saw further expansion. The Mekong and Chao Phraya rivers snaked through rich, fertile lands held by decadent, unstable kingdoms ripe for conquest."
KHMER5_INTRO_5 "Triumph would add yet another achievement to Suryavarman’s legendary military record."
KHMER5_OUTRO_1 "Hegemony is a wonderful thing. The power and prestige of the Khmer Empire reached new levels under Suryavarman I, and all prospered."
KHMER5_OUTRO_2 "Despite being known as a great conqueror, Suryavarman was not simply a militaristic aggressor. His reign was marked by vast improvements in the general infrastructure of the empire and an emphasis on religious toleration."
KHMER5_OUTRO_3 "He erected numerous palaces and temple complexes and ruled benevolently. His legacy lives through these structures, the pride of our citizens, and the strength of the Khmer Empire."
KHMER5_OUTRO_4 "This legacy is a cause worth defending, for Suryavarman’s image lives on within it. It is this notion of greatness that you must invoke to electrify the minds of the common soldiery."

VIETNAMESE1_INTRO_1 "Calm down, you scoundrel! Calm down and let me tell you a story."
VIETNAMESE1_INTRO_2 "Not too long ago, when your fathers were about your age, the Chinese returned to Dai Viet. After more than five hundred years of independence, the Vietnamese kingdom came once again under the thumb of a Chinese emperor. The Ming dynasty had come to assist a Vietnamese claimant to the throne, but as the country plummeted into chaos, the Ming emperor decided to take the kingdom for himself. Ming soldiers entered and occupied the Vietnamese villages and cities. But while the aristocracy prospered under Ming occupation, the common people suffered. It was clear that the Vietnamese people needed a hero to unite and free the country once more. This hero was Lê Lợi."
VIETNAMESE1_INTRO_3 "Lê Lợi was the son of a nobleman, but despite his heritage, he despised the other aristocracy who had sided with the enemy. Lê Lợi's family had founded a new town in northern Vietnam before the Ming occupation, far from the control of the Hanoi government. Here up far north, he gained the support of two famous families, the Trịnh and the Nguyen. Vastly outnumbered, Lê Lợi turned to waging a guerrilla war against the large and well-organized Ming army in 1418. His resistance could only succeed if he managed to avoid confrontation with the Ming and waited for the seeds of rebellion to bear fruit ..."
VIETNAMESE1_OUTRO_1 "It began slowly and with rather few successes, but soon Lê Lợi started to gain more and more support from the people. The people even dismissed the former Trần dynasty, calling Lê Lợi 'The Peacemaking King'. However, the Ming became wary of his actions and decided to act. A war was imminent..."

VIETNAMESE2_INTRO_1 "Then, disaster struck the Vietnamese rebels. Defeated in battle and chased by the Ming army, they retreated to a mountain fortress in Chí Linh but realized upon their arrival that there were few supplies remaining within. The mountain fortress had become a dead trap, with the Ming armies encircling it from all sides. The situation was dire for Lê Lợi and his fellow commanders on top of that barren mountain. The Ming brought a large army to assure that none of the rebels would be able to escape, and the destruction of the rebellion seemed inevitable."
VIETNAMESE2_OUTRO_1 "When all appeared to be lost, one of Lê Lợi's commanders, Lê Lai, devised a plan. While Lê Lợi and the main bulk of the army forced their escape through the less defended eastern flank, Lê Lai pretended to be Lê Lợi and led a frontal charge right into the Ming forces. Rushing into the mass of Ming soldiers, followed by his loyal men in the early morning sun, Lê Lai's final charge can be described nothing but glorious."
VIETNAMESE2_OUTRO_2 "It was a sad day for Lê Lợi and his men to have lost such a brave commander. Lê Lai died so that Lê Lợi and his men could continue the fight, and so they did. The rebels became more determined than ever before."

VIETNAMESE3_INTRO_1 "The rebellion started to pick up later that year and this time Lê Lợi could go on the offensive. The main goal for Lê Lợi was to take Hanoi and prevent Ming reinforcements to reach the garrisons in the southern Vietnamese cities."
VIETNAMESE3_INTRO_2 "However the Ming army was large and determined to keep the city."
VIETNAMESE3_OUTRO_1 "The Ming tried their best to prevent Hanoi from falling but in the end failed to do so. With Hanoi captured Lê Lợi had shown that the rebellion was well under way to achieve its goals. Now the Ming had learned to fear him. They knew he was a strong pretender for the throne and if they wanted to stop him they'd have to bring in a more experienced general."

VIETNAMESE4_INTRO_1 "Once Hanoi had fallen, Lê Lợi looked south, towards the Ming capital of Nghệ An. To get there, however, his army would have to pass by a fortress which was in the hands of Cam Banh, a Vietnamese magnate in service to the Ming. The Ming were not going to let the Vietnamese take the fortress so easily and so they sent their most capable general, Wang Tong, to lift the siege."
VIETNAMESE4_INTRO_2 "Wang Tong was an experienced tactician, a veteran of several Ming wars. If anyone was able to challenge Lê Lợi, it would be him."
VIETNAMESE4_OUTRO_1 "The Ming made several attempts to reach the fortress but the Vietnamese managed to repulse the large army of Wang Tong. The fortress fell and Cam Banh was captured, signifying another important turning point in the war. Wang Tong and his army weren't completely defeated but he had gotten himself in a bad position with low supplies. No longer able to attack the Vietnamese or prevent the Vietnamese rebels to go south, he retreated to a save location. Now the way south laid open for Lê Lợi's army... With Wang Tong following it closely."

VIETNAMESE5_INTRO_1 "In 1425 Lê Lợi wrote to Wang Tong: 'In the past, we had few weapons, now our warships line up like clouds, armors shine against the sun, firearms pile up and our gunpowder storage are full. Compared to the past, our transition to a position of strength has become apparent.'"
VIETNAMESE5_INTRO_2 "But despite the successes and increasing military power Lê Lợi soon found himself in another predicament. He needed to consolidate his gains in the south fast, before the Ming had a chance to react. Certainly with Wang Tong so closely on his tail, waiting for him to make a mistake. To achieve his goals Lê Lợi sent his commanders out to three different locations."
VIETNAMESE5_INTRO_3 "Dinh Le, commander of the cavalry, would move on the Ming citadel of Đồng Đô to keep Wang Tong occupied."
VIETNAMESE5_INTRO_4 "The expert swordsman Le Trien, would move north and try to intercept the reinforcements under the leadership of Liu Sheng who had broken through the northern defenses and were on their way south."
VIETNAMESE5_INTRO_5 "And the feared Luu Nhan Chu and wise Bui Bi would make a move on Nghe An."
VIETNAMESE5_INTRO_6 "Only if all three plans succeeded Tran Tri and his Ming forces could be prevented from striking back. Lê Lợi's plan hung by a thread. A very thin thread."
VIETNAMESE5_OUTRO_1 "The chances were stacked against the Vietnamese but somehow they still won. Liu Sheng and his Ming reinforcements were ambushed and killed while Wang Tong was marooned in the citadel of Đồng Đô. Nghệ An remained in Ming hands due to the gunpowder weapons the defenders possessed, still the Ming were on the losing side of the war and it was doubtful that even an able general like Wang Tong would be able to turn the tide."

VIETNAMESE6_INTRO_1 "The Ming had lost control over most of Dai Viet. It was only a matter of time before they would be utterly defeated. Lê Lợi however wanted to make peace and offered the Ming a peace deal where they'd divide the country. The Ming were prepared to accept it but the Vietnamese magnates did not want to give in. Lê Lợi gathered his whole army and marched for Đồng Đô where Wang Tong had retreated to. The remaining Ming army was still well supplied and strong even though no reinforcements could reach them from China. General Wang Tong would not go down without a fight."
VIETNAMESE6_OUTRO_1 "By 1427 the Ming had been defeated in battle and Đồng Đô had fallen. Lê Lợi and Wang Tong met in person south of the citadel where they made a pact to cease all hostilities. It was a glorious day for the Vietnamese as they once again gained their independence and formed a united kingdom under the leadership of the new king. The great Lê Lợi."
VIETNAMESE6_OUTRO_2 "The remaining Ming soldiers and commanders were at the mercy of the Vietnamese but Lê Lợi was a gracious and honorable winner. The Ming generals were invited to a lavish banquet and afterwards were allowed to lead the 86,640 remaining Ming soldiers back to China. 500 ships were allocated for those who wanted to travel over sea and over 20,000 captured men and horses were released. Among these generals was Wang Tong who also returned to China and later fought in many more Ming wars before retiring."
VIETNAMESE6_OUTRO_3 "Regardless of how well Lê Lợi treated the retreating Ming soldiers, he was aware that Dai Viet would never be safe from Chinese interventions once he was gone. So after Lê Lợi was crowned, he patched the relationship with the Chinese and gained with the Ming emperor the status of an independent tributary state for Dai Viet. It was a small cost for the reborn state in return for peace at its northern borders. And while Lê Lợi ended up doing much more great things for the country, things didn't keep being so great after he died, as he had expected. Internal struggles and politics contaminated the Vietnamese court like an infectious disease. Of all the famous heroes who fought with Lê Lợi, none died peacefully in their beds but even so, thanks to Lê Lợi, Dai Viet retains its independence under the leadership of the Le Dynasty till this day."
VIETNAMESE6_OUTRO_4 "You wonder why does a Chinese know so much of Vietnamese history and why does he hold that foreigner Lê Lợi in such high regard? Especially since he fought a long war against his own country and defeated its armies? Well that's because I am Wang Tong, former general and Lê Lợi's adversary. And in my many years of fighting I never have fought a more noble and smart commander than him. I do not easily think of others as my equal but we met several times to try to broker a peace between us and shared the same hardships during this war, even if it was on different sides. I respect that man as if he was my brother."
